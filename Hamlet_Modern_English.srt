and he won't believe...

...in this terrifying sight
we've seen twice.

for weapons...

...whose ghost
just appeared to us...

challenged by Fortinbras of Norway...

For that's how

—killed this Fortinbras...

...who, by a sealed agreement,

83
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:16,065

...lost all his lands

84
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,776
with his life...
...which he had owned

85
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:21,570
to the conqueror.
In exchange for which a fair portion...

86
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,531
...was pledged by our king, which would have returned

87
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:27,410
to Fortinbras' inheritance...
...had he won,

88
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,454
as, by the same agreement...
...and terms outlined,

89
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:34,583
his lands went to Hamlet.
HORATIO: Now, young Fortinbras,

90
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:40,214

...has gathered in the outskirts of Norway

91
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:43,092
here and there...
...a group of landless adventurers

92
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:48,055
for food and supplies for some venture...
...that has a purpose,

93
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:50,766
which is none other—
And it's clear to our state.

94
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:52,935
—but to reclaim from us by force...

95
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,354
...and under compulsion

96
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:58,941
those lands mentioned before...
...which his father lost.

97
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,860
And this, I believe,

98
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:04,864
is the main reason for our preparations...
...the cause of this watch,

99
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:07,867
and the main reason...
...for this urgent activity

100

that this ominous figure...

103
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:22,256
...comes armed through our watch
looking so much like the king...

104
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:24,508
...that was and is the question
of these wars.

105
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:27,511

106
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:33,184
In the great and prosperous state of Rome,
a little before the mighty Julius fell...

107
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:37,313
...the graves were empty
and the shrouded dead...

108
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:40,983
...squeaked and gibbered
in the Roman streets.

109
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:46,238
And just like the signs of feared events,
as messengers always preceding fate...

110
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,491
...and a prelude to the coming omen...

111
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,868
...heaven and earth
have shown together...

112
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:53,537
...to our climate and countrymen.

113
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:59,418

and bloody dew...

And the wet star...

...on whose influence
Neptune's empire depends...

117

...was almost sick to doomsday
with an eclipse.

118
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:13,140
But wait, look.
Look, here it comes again.

119
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,893
I'll confront it even if it harms me.

120

00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:22,149
If you have any sound or voice,
speak to me.

122
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:26,529
If there's anything good to be done
that might help you and benefit me...

123
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,114
...speak to me.

124
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,407
If you know your country's fate...

125
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,785
...which knowing might help avoid it,
Oh, speak.

126
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:36,997
Or if you have hidden in your life
stolen treasure in the earth...

127
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,375
...for, they say,
spirits often walk in death...

128
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:42,628
...speak for it, stay and speak.
Stop it, Marcellus.

129
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:45,256
- Should I strike it with my spear?
- Do it if it won't stay.

130
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:46,882
MARCELLUS: It's here.
- It's here.

131
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,263
It's gone.

132
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:58,811
We do wrong, being so majestic,
to show it violence...

133
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:02,857
...for it's as invulnerable as air...

134
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:06,986
...and our pointless blows are a mockery.

135
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:09,238
It was about to speak
when the rooster crowed.

136
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:14,410
And then it jumped like a guilty thing...

137
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:16,537
...at a scary call.

138
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:20,416
I've heard
the rooster, which is the morning's trumpet...

139
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:24,086
...with its loud
and high-pitched voice...

140
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:26,714
...wakes up the god of day...

141
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:31,427
...and at its warning,
whether in sea or fire, on earth or in air...

142
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:36,182
...the wandering spirit hurries
back to its limit.

143
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,476
And of the truth in this,
this current sight proved it.

144
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,937
BARNARDO:
It disappeared at the rooster's crow.

145
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:44,815
Some say that always before
the season comes...

146
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:48,444
...when our savior's birth
is celebrated...

147
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:51,822
...the rooster
sings all night long.

148
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,618
And then, they say,
no spirit can walk around...

149
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,454
...the nights are healthy.

150
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,582
Then no planets strike...

151
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:06,378
...no fairy can take,
nor witch has the power to charm...

152
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:12,051
...so sacred and so gracious
is this time.

153
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:18,557
I've heard and partly believe it.

But look, the morning
dressed in reddish-brown...

155
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:26,190
...walks over the dew
of that high hill to the east.

156
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:31,111
Let's end our watch,
and if you agree...

157
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,572
...let's tell
what we've seen tonight...

158
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,574
...to young Hamlet.

159
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:41,622
I bet my life,
this ghost, silent to us, will speak to him.

160
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:45,834
Do you agree we should tell him,
as it's important for our friendship and duty?

161
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,003
Let's do it, please.

And I know this morning
where we can find him easily.

163

Even though Hamlet,
our dear brother's death...

164
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:38,345
...is still fresh in our minds,
and it was right for us...

165
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:41,724
...to mourn deeply,
and for our whole kingdom...

166
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:45,060
...to be united in sorrow...

167
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:50,065
...yet wisdom has
fought with nature...

168
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:54,028
...so that with the wisest sorrow
we remember him...

169
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:57,281
...along with thinking
of ourselves.

170
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:01,160
Therefore, our former sister...

of this warlike state...

...we have
as if with a bittersweet joy...

174
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:18,844
...with one happy
and one tearful eye...

175
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:22,931
...with joy at a funeral
and sadness at a wedding...

176
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:26,602
...balancing delight and grief...
...taken as our wife.

177
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,188
Nor have we ignored

178
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:35,986
your better judgment...
...which has freely supported

179

lost by his father, with all legal rights...

We've written

to Norway, young Fortinbras' uncle...

192

...who's old and bedridden, barely aware
of his nephew's plans...

193
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:32,126
...to stop his further actions,
since the troops...

194

...the lists, and full preparations are all made
from his subjects.

And we now send
you, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand...

...as messengers
to Old Norway...

...giving you no further authority
to deal with the king...

...beyond what's detailed
in these extended articles.

what's going on with you?

You mentioned some request.
What is it, Laertes?

You can speak to the king

What would you ask for, Laertes,
that I wouldn't offer before you even ask?

208

The head is as close to the heart,
the hand as useful to the mouth...

to your father.

What do you want, Laertes?

My respected Lord,
your permission to return to France...

Do you have your father's permission?
What does Polonius say?

00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,634
He has, my lord,
reluctantly given me his permission...

218
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:09,181
...after much persuasion, and finally
I gave my difficult consent to his wishes.

Not at all, my lord...

Yes, madam, it is common.

If it is,

Seems, madam?

No, it is.

I don't know "seems."

00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:30,053
It's not just my dark cloak,

...nor my usual mourning clothes,

nor deep sighs...
...no, nor the tears in my eyes,

nor the sad expression on my face...
...along with all the forms,

moods, and signs of grief...
...that truly show who I am.

243
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,196
These indeed "seem"...

244
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,449
...because they are actions

245
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:54,244
that anyone could fake.
But I have something inside

246
00:15:55,288 --> 00:16:00,334
that goes beyond appearances.
These are just the outward signs

247
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:05,589
and the clothes of mourning.
It's admirable

248
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:09,468
in your nature, Hamlet...
...to pay these respects

249
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:12,262
to your father.
But you must understand

00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:15,807
your father also lost a father.

That father is gone, he's lost.

252

And the one left behind is bound
by family duty for a time...

00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,608
...to show proper mourning.

But to keep
stubbornly grieving is a path...

255

...of disrespectful stubbornness,
it's unmanly grief...

256

a weak heart, an impatient mind...

...a simple
and uneducated understanding.

...so loving to my mother...

309
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,918
...that he wouldn't even let
the gentle winds of heaven...

310
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:14,212
...touch her face too harshly.

311
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,674
Oh, must I remember all this?

312
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:22,262
She used to cling to him
as if her desire grew...

313
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:25,056
...the more she had of him,
and yet within a month—

314
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,892
I can't bear to think about it.

315
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,310
Weakness, thy name is woman.

316
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,980
Just a little month,
before those shoes were even old...

317
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:34,482
...the ones she wore to follow
my poor father's body...

318
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:39,487
...like Niobe, full of tears,
she, even she—

319
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:43,325
Oh God, even an animal
that lacks the ability to reason...

320
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,368
...would have mourned longer.

321
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,913
—married my uncle...

322
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,373
...my father's brother...

323
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,876
...but as different from my father
as I am from Hercules...

324
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:55,253
...within a month...

325
00:20:55,504 --> 00:21:01,676
...before the salt of her fake tears
had dried in her red eyes...

326
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:04,679
...she got married.

327
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:09,309
Oh, what wicked speed...

328
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:15,982
...to rush so quickly
into an incestuous bed.

329
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:19,486
It won't...

330
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:24,074
...and it can't turn out well.

331
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:29,704
But break, my heart...

332
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:32,958
...because I must stay silent.

333
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,879
Hello to you, sir.

334
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:40,715
I'm happy to see you doing well.

335
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,429
Horatio.

336
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:50,141
Or maybe I've forgotten myself.

337
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,852
Yes, it's me, my lord,
and always your humble servant.

338
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,939
Sir, my good friend,
I'll swap that title with you.

339
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:59,317
So what brings you from Wittenberg,
Horatio? Marcellus.

340
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:01,569
- My good lord.
- I'm very glad to see you.

341
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:02,946
Good evening, sir.

342
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:05,198
But honestly,
what brings you from Wittenberg?

343
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:07,075
Just a wandering spirit, my good lord.

344
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:10,745
I wouldn't let your enemy say that,
and you shouldn't make me believe it...

345
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:14,958
...by saying it yourself. I know you're not a slacker.
So what's your business in Elsinore?

346
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:18,169
We'll teach you to drink deeply

347
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:21,423
before you leave.
My lord, I came to see

348
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,758
your father's funeral.
Please don't make fun of me, fellow student.

349
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:27,929
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
- Indeed, my lord, it came right after.

350
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:31,266
- Saving money, saving money, Horatio.

351
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:36,062
The food from the funeral
was used coldly for the wedding feast.

352
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:41,359
I wish I had met my worst enemy in heaven
before I ever saw that day, Horatio.

353
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:45,739
My father.

354
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:50,285
I think I see my father.

355
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:52,454
Where, my lord?

356
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:56,875
In my mind's eye, Horatio.

357
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,837
I saw him once.

358
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:04,466
He was a great king.

359
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,052
He was a man.

360
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:10,180
Consider him in every way...

361
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,766
...I will never see someone like him again.

362
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,642
My lord...

363
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:18,188
...I think...

364
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:24,110
...I saw him last night.

365
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,822
Saw?

366
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,034
Who?

367
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:34,496
My lord, the king...

368
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:37,832
...your father.

369
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,250
The king, my father?

370
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,879
Hold your amazement for a moment
and listen carefully while I tell...

371
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:46,508
...with the testimony of these gentlemen,
this wonder to you.

372
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,177
For God's sake, let me hear it.

373
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:56,684
For two nights in a row, these gentlemen,
Marcellus and Barnardo, on their watch...

374
00:23:56,852 --> 00:24:00,063
...in the dead of night,
encountered this.

375
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:03,858
A figure like your father,
fully armed from head to toe...

376
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:06,444
...appears before them,
and with a solemn march...

377
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:08,321
...walks slowly and with dignity past them.

378
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:11,741
Three times he passed by their overwhelmed
and frightened eyes...

379
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:14,953
...within arm's reach,
while they were almost...

380
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:19,707
...frozen with fear,
stood silent and didn't speak to him.

381
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,669
They told me this in strict confidence...
...and I joined them on the third night

382
00:24:22,837 --> 00:24:25,421
to keep watch...
...where, as they described,

383
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:29,634
both in time...
...and form of the figure,

384
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:33,179
every word was true...
...the ghost appeared.

385
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:35,265
I knew your father.

386
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:38,226
- These hands are not more similar.

387
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:41,104
- But where was this?
On the platform where we kept watch.

388
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:43,064
- Did you speak to it?

389
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:45,108
- My lord, I did.
But it didn't answer.

390
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:47,652
Yet once I thought...
...it lifted its head and seemed

391
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,656
like it was going to speak...
...but just then the morning rooster

392
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:54,242
crowed loudly...
...and at the sound, it quickly shrank away

393
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:58,454
and disappeared from our sight.
That's very strange.

394
00:24:58,747 --> 00:24:59,998
As I live, my honored lord, it's true.

395
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:03,418
We thought it was our duty

396
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:06,421
to let you know about it.
Indeed, indeed, gentlemen.

397
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:08,715
But this worries me.

398
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:11,885
Are you on watch tonight?

399
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:13,720
- We are.

400
00:25:13,888 --> 00:25:15,096
- Armed, you say?

401
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,806
BOTH: Yes, my lord, he was armed.
- From head to toe?

402
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:19,184
- From head to foot.
- Then you didn't see his face.

403
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,394
Oh yes, my lord, his visor was up.

404
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:23,396
How did he look? Was he frowning?

405
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:26,524
- He looked more sad than angry.
- Was he pale or flushed?

406
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:28,651
- Very pale.
- Did he keep his eyes on you?

407
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:29,819
Yes, he did.

408
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:31,696
I wish I had been there.

409
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:35,158
- It would have really surprised you.
- Very likely...

410
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,619
...very likely.

411
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:41,247
- Did he stay long?
- Long enough to count to a hundred.

412
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:43,416
- Longer, longer.
- Not when I saw it.

413
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:45,210
His beard was gray, right?

414
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,880
It was like I remember it in life,
a dark gray with silver.

415
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:51,549
I'll watch tonight.

416
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,093
Maybe it'll appear again.

417
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,762
I'm sure it will.

418
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:59,307
If it looks like my noble father...

419
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:03,436
...I'll speak to it even if hell itself
opens up...

420
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:05,980
...and tells me to stay silent.

421
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:10,485
I ask you all,
if you've kept this sight a secret so far...

422
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:13,696
...keep it that way...

423
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:16,699
...and whatever else
happens tonight...

424
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:19,744
...understand it but don't speak of it.

425
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:22,413
I'll repay your kindness.

426
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:23,998
So goodbye for now.

427
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:31,881
I'll meet you on the platform between 11 and 12.
I'll see you then.

428
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:37,762
- Our duty to you, sir.
- Your loyalty, as mine is to you.

429
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,764
Goodbye.

430
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,976
HAMLET:
My father's ghost in armor.

431
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:45,144
Something's wrong.

432
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:47,146
I suspect foul play.

433
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,023
I wish it were night already.

434
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:53,278
Until then, stay calm, my soul.

435
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:00,493
Bad deeds will come to light...

436
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:06,416
...even if they're buried deep,
for all to see.

437
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,594
My things are packed. Goodbye.

438
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:24,058
And sister, as the winds are favorable
and the ship is ready, don't delay...

439
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:25,643
...but write to me.

440
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:28,229
Do you doubt that?

441
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:36,112
As for Hamlet and his affection,
consider it a youthful whim...

442
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:41,576
...a fleeting passion,
exciting but not lasting...

443
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:44,704
...like a flower that blooms briefly,
nothing more.

444
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:47,707
- Nothing more than that?
- Think of it as nothing more.

445
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:51,502
For as we grow, we don't just grow
in size and strength...

446
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:55,131
...but as his body matures,
the mind and soul...

447
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:56,591
...grow as well.

448
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:59,218
Maybe he loves you now...

449
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:04,932
...and right now nothing tarnishes
his intentions. But you should worry...

450
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:10,271
...considering his status,
his choices aren't his alone...

451
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:13,399
...because he's bound by his birth.

452
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:15,777
He can't, like people who aren't valued...

453
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,529
...make decisions for himself,
because his choice affects...

454
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:21,240
...the well-being and stability
of the entire state.

455
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,951
So his decision must be
limited...

456
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:28,581
...to the opinions and consent of the group
that he leads.

457
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:33,044
So if he says he loves you,
you should only believe it...

458
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:37,632
...as much as his actions and position
support his words...

459
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:42,553
...which is only as far
as the main opinion in Denmark allows.

460
00:28:43,097 --> 00:28:45,473
Consider what damage
your reputation might suffer...

461
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:49,602
...if you listen too easily
to his sweet talk...

462
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:52,105
...or fall for him...

463
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:57,902
...or give up your purity
to his uncontrolled persistence.

464
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:01,197
Be careful, Ophelia, be careful, my dear sister...

465
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:06,661
...and keep your feelings in check,
away from the risks of desire.

466
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:11,833
Even the most cautious girl is too reckless
if she reveals her beauty to the night.

467
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,294
Even virtue itself doesn't escape
slanderous attacks.

468
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:19,465
The worm harms the early buds of spring
too often before they even bloom...

469
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:23,845
...and in the morning
and fresh dew of youth...

470
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:27,849
...harmful influences
are most likely.

471
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:31,727
Be cautious then. The safest path is to be wary.

472
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:35,898
Youth rebels against itself,
even if no one else is around.

473
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:40,361
I'll keep this good advice
as a guard to my heart.

474
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:45,741
But, dear brother,
don't be like some hypocritical preachers...

475
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:48,286
...who show me the difficult
and thorny path to heaven...

476
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:50,913
...while like a puffed-up
and careless playboy...

477
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:53,541
...they walk the easy path
of pleasure...

478
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:55,626
...and ignore their own advice.

479
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:58,796
Oh, don't worry about me.

480
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:03,342
- I've stayed too long.
POLONIUS: Still here, Laertes?

481
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,802
But here comes my father.

482
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:08,639
A double blessing is a double gift.
It's a good time for a second farewell.

483
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,850
Get on board, get on board, for shame.

484
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:14,061
The wind is in your favor,
and they're waiting for you.

485
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,938
Here's my blessing for you.

486
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:21,068
And remember these few rules,
make sure you remember them.

487
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,738
Don't speak every thought you have...

488
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:26,908
...or act on every impulse.

489
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:29,952
Be friendly but not overly familiar.

490
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:32,830
The friends you have,
and have proven themselves...

491
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:35,416
...hold them close to your heart
like "hoops of steel"...

492
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,252
...but don't wear yourself out
by entertaining...

493
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,797
...every new,
untested friend.

494
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:45,885
Avoid getting into fights,
but if you do...

495
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:49,472
...handle it so that your opponent
will think twice about challenging you.

496
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,558
Listen to everyone,
but speak to few.

497
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:56,479
Take everyone's opinion,
but keep your own judgment.

498
00:30:56,647 --> 00:31:01,734
Dress as well as you can afford,
but not too flashy.

499
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:03,903
Rich but not showy.

500
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:06,405
Because clothes often make the man...

501
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,950
...and they are in France
of the highest rank and status...

502
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:12,370
...are the most distinguished
and generous leaders in that regard.

503
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:15,581
Don't be a borrower or a lender...

504
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:18,501
...because loans often result in losing
both the money and the friend...

505
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:22,755
...and borrowing weakens
financial responsibility.

506
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,800
Above all else:

507
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:29,136
Be true to yourself...

508
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:34,642
...and just like night follows day,
you won't be false to anyone.

509
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:36,519
Goodbye.

510
00:31:36,687 --> 00:31:39,480
May my blessing guide you in this.

511
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:45,945
I humbly take my leave, my lord.

512
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:49,782
It's time for you to go.
Go. Your servants are waiting.

513
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:55,663
Goodbye, Ophelia...

514
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:59,542
...and remember well
what I've told you.

515
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:02,253
It's locked in my memory...

516
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:05,631
...and you will keep
the key to it.

517
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:12,346
Goodbye.

518
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,284
POLONIUS:
What did he say to you, Ophelia?

519
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:34,702
[BELL CHIMING]

520
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:37,246
OPHELIA:
If it pleases you...

521
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:41,459
...something about Lord Hamlet.

522
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:43,794
POLONIUS:
Indeed, well considered.

523
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:49,300
I've been told that he has recently
spent private time with you...

524
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:54,930
...and you have been
very open and generous with him.

525
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:58,434
If that's true-- As it's been told to me,
and as a warning.

526
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:02,730
--I must tell you
you don't understand yourself clearly enough...

527
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:06,734
...as my daughter should
and for your own honor.

528
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:09,779
What's going on between you two?

529
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:11,989
Tell me the truth.

530
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:15,576
He has, my lord, recently...

531
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:17,745
...shown many signs
of affection towards me.

532
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:19,163
POLONIUS:
Affection, nonsense.

533
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:23,959
You speak like a naive girl
inexperienced in such risky situations.

534
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:26,087
Do you believe his "affection"
as you call it?

535
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:29,048
I don't know, my lord,
what to think.

536
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:31,342
Well, I'll teach you:
think of yourself as a child...

537
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:35,096
...for believing his affections
are genuine when they're not.

538
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:36,305
Value yourself highly...

539
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:39,725
...or, to put it plainly, you'll make me look foolish.

540
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:43,688
My lord, he has pursued me with love
in an honorable way--

541
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,940
Yes, you could call it "fashion."
Enough, enough.

542
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:50,319
And he has supported his words
with almost all the sacred vows.

543
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:52,738
Yes, traps to catch the naive.

544
00:33:52,906 --> 00:33:55,574
I know when passion is strong
how freely the soul...

545
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:56,992
...makes promises.

546
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:00,746
These flames, daughter,
give more light than heat, and fade quickly...

547
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:04,208
...even as they promise, while being made,
you must not mistake them for true fire.

548
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:07,336
From now on, be less available
with your presence.

549
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:10,756
Value your time more
than just a simple conversation.

550
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:13,884
As for Lord Hamlet,
remember that he is young...

551
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:17,179
...and he can roam more freely
than you are allowed.

552
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:18,681
In short, Ophelia...

553
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:21,642
...don't trust his promises,
because they are like agents...

554
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:24,061
...not true to the appearance
they present...

555
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,731
...but just asking for improper favors...

556
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:31,318
...pretending to be holy and sincere
to deceive you better.

557
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:35,156
That's all. I don't want you,
to put it simply, from now on...

558
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,324
...to waste any free time...
...by speaking or chatting

559
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,952
with Lord Hamlet.
Pay attention, I'm warning you.

560
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:42,496
Let's go.

561
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,374

00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:52,339
I will obey...
...my lord.

563
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,676
HAMLET:

564
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:01,474
The air is biting, it's really cold.
It's sharp and biting.

565
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,225
- What time is it now?

566
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:05,186
- I think it's almost midnight.
No, it's already struck.

567
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,313
Really? I didn't hear it.

568
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:10,983
Then it's almost the time

569
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:15,488
when the ghost usually appears.

What does this mean, my lord?
HAMLET: The king is awake tonight

572
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,953
and is partying...
...having a feast,

573
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:26,373
and the rowdy dance begins.
And as he drinks his wine...

574
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,709
...the drums and trumpets loudly announce
the success of his toast.

575
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:32,046
- Is it a tradition?
- Yes, indeed it is.

576
00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:33,756
But in my opinion, even though I'm from here
and grew up with it...

577
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:36,926
...it's a tradition better broken
than followed.

578
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:40,095
This heavy partying, east and west...
...makes us criticized

579
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:42,348
and judged by other countries...

580
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:44,850
...they call us drunkards,
and with insulting words...

581
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:48,187
...tarnish our reputation.
And it actually diminishes

...that due to some flaw

in their nature...

586
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:04,620
...from birth, which isn't their fault
since nature decides their origin...

587
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:09,083
...by the excess
of some trait...

588
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:11,418
...often breaking down the barriers
and defenses of reason...

589
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:14,588

- No, definitely not.

- Don't, my lord.

Why should I be afraid?
I don't value my life much at all...

It's beckoning me again.
I'll follow it.

What if it lures you to the water?

Or to the top of the cliff
that hangs over the sea?

And there it might take on
some other terrifying form...

...that could rob you
of your sanity...

...and drive you mad?

612

Think about it.
This very place puts desperate thoughts...

613

...into everyone's mind
who looks down at the sea...

614
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:34,835
...and hears it roar below.

615

- It's still calling me. Go on, I'll follow you.
- You can't go.

00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,591
- Let go of me.
- Listen to reason. You can't go.

617
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:42,843
My destiny calls out to me.

618
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:46,931
And makes every tiny artery in my body
as strong as the Nemean lion's sinew.

619
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:50,267
I'm still being called. Let go of me, gentlemen.

620
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:53,604
By heaven,
I'll make a ghost of anyone who stops me.

621
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:55,773
I said, let go!

622
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:59,902
Go on, I'll follow you.

623
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:03,906
- He's getting reckless with his imagination.
- Let's follow him. It's not right to just let him go.

624
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:07,034
Let's go after him. What will come of this?

625
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:09,954
Something is wrong
in the state of Denmark.

626
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,039
Heaven will guide it.

627
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:13,582
No, let's follow him.

628
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:16,627
HAMLET:
Angels and protectors, defend us.

629
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,879
Whether you're a good spirit
or a damned ghost...

630
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:21,382
...bringing breezes from heaven
or blasts from hell...

631
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:24,885
...whether your intentions are evil or kind,
you come in such a form...

632
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,387
...that I will speak to you.

633
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:29,640
I'll call you Hamlet,
king, father, royal Dane.

634
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:31,141
Oh, answer me!

635
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,268
Don't let me die in ignorance...

636
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:37,690
...but tell me why your sacred bones,
buried in death...

637
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:39,316
...have broken through their shroud...

638
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:42,486
...why the tomb
where we saw you peacefully buried...

639
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:45,948
...has opened its heavy marble jaws
to spit you out again.

640
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:47,366
What does this mean...

641
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:50,244
...that you, a dead body,
fully armored...

642
00:38:50,412 --> 00:38:53,747
...are revisiting the moonlit night,
making it terrifying...

643
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:56,917
...and causing us, mere humans,
to tremble so horribly...

644
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:59,294
...with thoughts beyond
our understanding?

645
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:01,296
Tell me, why is this? Why?

646
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:02,881
What should we do?

647
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:07,761
Where are you leading me?

648
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:09,763
Speak.

649
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:11,807
I'll go no further.

650
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:14,601
GHOST: Listen to me.
HAMLET: I will.

651
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,812
GHOST:
My time is almost here...

652
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,940
...when I must give myself up...
...to sulfurous and tormenting flames.

653
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:21,984
HAMLET:

654
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:23,402
Oh, poor ghost.

655
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:28,949
GHOST: Don't pity me, but listen closely
to what I'm about to tell you.

656
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:30,659
HAMLET:
Speak, I'm ready to listen.

657
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:34,872
GHOST: You must also be ready for revenge
when you hear what I have to say.

658
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,081
HAMLET:
What?

659
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:40,127
I am your father's spirit...

660
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:43,839
...doomed for a certain time
to wander at night...

661
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:48,427
...and during the day
trapped in fires...

662
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:52,306
...until the terrible deeds
I did in my lifetime...

663
00:39:52,474 --> 00:39:55,642
...are burned and purified away.

664
00:39:56,811 --> 00:40:01,899
But I'm not allowed
to reveal the secrets of my prison...

665
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:06,153
...or I could tell a story
whose simplest word...

666
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:10,365
...would tear at your soul,
freeze your young blood...

667
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:15,204
...make your eyes pop out
like stars from their sockets...

668
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:18,373
...make your hair stand up...
...and each individual hair

669
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:22,377
stand on end...
...like quills on an angry porcupine.

670
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:26,423

671
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:32,679
But this eternal revelation can't be
shared with living ears.

672
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:38,769
Listen, Hamlet, listen, oh listen.

673
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:44,024
- If you ever loved your dear father--
- Oh, God!

674
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:47,986
Avenge his horrible
and unnatural murder.

675
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:53,867
- Murder?
- Murder most foul, as it always is...

676
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:59,498
...but this one is especially foul, strange,
and unnatural.

677
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:00,833
Hurry to find out...

678
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,378
...so that with wings as swift
as thought or love...

679
00:41:04,546 --> 00:41:06,338
...I can rush to my revenge.

680
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:07,589
I find you ready...

681
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:10,509
...and you'd be slower than the lazy weed...
...that grows comfortably on the banks of Lethe,

682
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:16,140
if you didn't act on this.

683
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,016
Now, Hamlet, listen.

684
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:20,936
It's been said that,
while sleeping in my orchard...

685
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:23,063
...a snake bit me.

686
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:26,066
So the whole of Denmark...

687
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:31,363
...is misled by a false account of my death.

688
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:35,993
But know this, noble young man,
the snake that took your father's life...

689
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:38,704
...now wears his crown.

690
00:41:38,872 --> 00:41:42,040
Oh, my prophetic soul. My uncle?

691
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:47,754
GHOST: Yes, that incestuous,
adulterous beast...

692
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:52,759
...with his cunning words,
and treacherous gifts--

693
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:58,765
Oh, wicked wit and gifts,
that have the power to seduce.

694
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:01,852
--won over to his shameful desires...

695
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:07,691
...the will of my seemingly
virtuous queen.

696
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:10,485
Oh, Hamlet...

697
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:14,406
...what a downfall that was.

698
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:20,537
From me, whose love was so noble
that it matched...

699
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:24,708
...the vow
I made to her in marriage...

700
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:27,961
...to fall for a wretch...

701
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:32,299
...whose natural talents were lacking
compared to mine.

702
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:35,802
But virtue will never be swayed...

703
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:39,431
...even if immorality tries to seduce it
in a heavenly form...

704
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:43,518
...just as lust,
even when connected to a radiant angel...

705
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:46,939
...will satisfy itself in a heavenly bed...

706
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:50,484
...and then feed on trash.

707
00:42:50,652 --> 00:42:53,487
But wait, I think I smell
the morning air.

708
00:42:53,655 --> 00:42:55,364
Let me be brief.

709
00:42:55,531 --> 00:43:01,203
While I was sleeping in my orchard,
as I usually did in the afternoon...

710
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:05,582
...during my peaceful time, your uncle snuck in...

711
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:09,503
...with a vial of cursed poison...
...and poured it into my ears...

712
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:14,716
...the deadly liquid...
...which has such a hostile effect on human blood...

713
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:18,679
...that as quickly as mercury...
...it flows through

714
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:21,098
the body's natural pathways...

715
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:25,644
...and with sudden force
it thickens...

716
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:28,480
...and curdles, like sour drops in milk,
the thin and healthy blood.

717
00:43:28,648 --> 00:43:35,028
That's what it did to mine.
And a horrible rash covered me...

718
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:37,364
...like a leper,

719
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:41,076
with a disgusting and loathsome crust...

720
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:45,122
...all over my smooth body.
So I was, while sleeping...

721
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:49,209
...by my brother's hand...

722
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:53,505
...robbed of life, crown, and queen...

723
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:56,258
...all at once...

724
00:43:56,426 --> 00:44:00,137
...cut off

725
00:44:00,305 --> 00:44:03,140
even in the middle of my sins...

726
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:07,936
...without last rites, unprepared, unanointed...
...no chance to make amends,

727
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:14,109
but sent to my fate...

728
00:44:14,277 --> 00:44:18,739
...with all my flaws still on me.
Oh, horrible...

729
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:23,702
...oh, horrible...

730
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:27,080
...most horrible.

731
00:44:27,248 --> 00:44:30,584
If you have any natural feelings, don't let it happen.

732
00:44:30,752 --> 00:44:34,087
Don't let the royal bed of Denmark become

733
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:37,883
a place for lust and cursed incest.

734
00:44:38,051 --> 00:44:43,889
But however you pursue this task...
...don't corrupt your mind...

735
00:44:44,057 --> 00:44:47,559
...or let your soul plot

736
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:50,604
against your mother.

737
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:56,360
Leave her to heaven...
...and to the guilt

738
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,612
that will torment her...

739
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:02,324
...to prick and sting her.
Farewell for now.

740
00:45:02,492 --> 00:45:06,119
The glow-worm shows that morning is near,

741
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:07,621
and its weak light begins to fade.

742
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:12,751
Goodbye, goodbye, Hamlet.
Remember me.

743
00:45:12,919 --> 00:45:16,171
Oh, all you hosts of heaven.

744
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:19,591
Oh earth. What else?

745
00:45:22,345 --> 00:45:28,058
And should I include hell?

746
00:45:32,772 --> 00:45:36,066
Oh no.

747
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:40,654
Hold on, hold on, my heart...

748
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:44,074
...and you, my muscles, don't grow old suddenly,

749
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:48,745
but keep me strong.

750
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:54,960

751
00:45:55,128 --> 00:45:57,295
Remember me?

752
00:45:58,047 --> 00:46:02,676
Yes, you poor ghost...

753
00:46:02,844 --> 00:46:06,888
...as long as I have a memory
in this troubled mind.

754
00:46:07,056 --> 00:46:09,516
Remember you? Yes...

755
00:46:09,684 --> 00:46:14,187
...I'll erase all unimportant memories
from my mind...

756
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:18,275
...all sayings from books, all forms,
all past impressions...

757
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:20,902
...that youth and experience
have recorded there...

758
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:26,700
...and your command will be the only thing
in the book of my mind...

759
00:46:26,868 --> 00:46:29,077
...unmixed with lesser things.

760
00:46:29,245 --> 00:46:31,580
Yes, by heaven.

761
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:35,834
Oh, most wicked woman!

762
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:39,629
Oh villain, villain, smiling, damned villain.

763
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,548
My notes...

764
00:46:41,716 --> 00:46:46,511
...it's fitting I write it down
that someone can smile and smile and still be a villain.

765
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:48,555
At least I'm sure
it can happen in Denmark.

766
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:53,560
So uncle, there you are.

767
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:56,396
Now to my promise:

768
00:46:56,564 --> 00:47:01,693
It is, "Goodbye, goodbye...

769
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:04,279
...remember me."

770
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:08,617
I've sworn it.

771
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:12,621
- My lord!
- My lord!

772
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:14,581
- My lord!

- Oh, it's amazing.

- My lord, tell us.
- You'll reveal it.

you might say, "not very well...

or "gentleman"...

At "agrees with you."

900
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:58,192
Yes, indeed,
he agrees with me like this:

"I know the guy,
I saw him yesterday"—

902
00:54:01,113 --> 00:54:03,489
Or the day before,
Or whenever.

—"with so-and-so, and like you said...

905

"I saw him go into a certain place"...

926
00:55:20,693 --> 00:55:23,194
...no hat on his head,
his stockings dirty...

927
00:55:23,362 --> 00:55:25,947
...not fastened, and hanging
down to his ankle...

928
00:55:26,115 --> 00:55:29,742
...pale as his shirt,
his knees knocking together...

929
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:32,412
...and with such a pitiful look...

930
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:35,957
...as if he had come from hell
to talk about horrors...

931
00:55:36,125 --> 00:55:37,375
...he came to me.

932
00:55:37,543 --> 00:55:40,586
- Crazy because of your love?
- My lord, I don't know.

933
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:43,089
- But I really do fear it.
- What did he say?

934
00:55:43,257 --> 00:55:47,760
He grabbed me by the wrist
and held me tight...

935
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:50,763
...then stretched out
his arm...

936
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:54,559
...and with his other hand
over his forehead...

937
00:55:54,727 --> 00:56:00,189
...he stared at my face
like he was trying to memorize it.

938
00:56:01,734 --> 00:56:03,943
He stayed like that for a long time.

939
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:08,906
Finally, he gave my arm a little shake...

940
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:12,785
...and nodded his head
up and down three times...

941
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:17,540
...he let out a sigh
so deep and sad...

942
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:23,463
...it seemed to shake his whole body
and end his life.

943
00:56:24,465 --> 00:56:27,216
After that, he let me go...

944
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:31,512
...and, with his head
turned over his shoulder...

945
00:56:32,431 --> 00:56:35,808
...he seemed to find his way
without looking...

946
00:56:36,602 --> 00:56:40,438
...because he went outside
without using his eyes...

947
00:56:40,606 --> 00:56:43,941
...and until the end
kept his gaze on me.

POLONIUS:
Come on.

949
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:52,408
Come with me.

950
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:54,869
I'm going to find the king.

951
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:59,791
This is the intense madness of love,
which is so intense it destroys itself...

952
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:02,376
...and drives people
to desperate actions...

953
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:06,547
...as often as any emotion on earth
that troubles us.

954
00:57:06,715 --> 00:57:08,132
I'm sorry.

[OPHELIA CRYING]

956
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:12,220
Have you said anything harsh to him recently?
No, my lord,

957
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:15,473
but as you instructed...
...I rejected his letters and refused

958
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:20,061
to see him.
That's what made him crazy.

959
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:26,359
I'm sorry I didn't pay more attention

960
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:29,195
and use better judgment...
...to understand him.

961
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:31,197
I was afraid he was just playing around

962
00:57:31,782 --> 00:57:35,535
and meant to hurt you.
But curse my jealousy.

963
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:38,246
Honestly, it's typical for people our age

964
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:43,584
to overthink things...
...just like it's common for younger people

965
00:57:43,752 --> 00:57:47,797
to lack wisdom.

Let's go to the king.

967
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:59,892
This needs to be known,

968
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:04,564
because keeping it secret might cause...
...more pain to hide

969

than trouble to reveal.
Let's go.

Welcome, dear Rosencrantz

971
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:24,917
and Guildenstern.
Besides the fact that we really wanted

972
00:58:25,085 --> 00:58:27,128
to see you...
...we urgently needed your help,

973
00:58:27,296 --> 00:58:31,257
so we sent for you quickly.
You've heard something

974
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:35,469
about Hamlet's change.
That's what I'll call it...

975
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:36,637
...since neither his appearance nor his mind

976
00:58:36,805 --> 00:58:41,642
is the same as it was.
What could be causing it...

977
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:42,810
...besides his father's death,

978
00:58:42,978 --> 00:58:45,396
that has made him...
...so confused about himself,

979
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:48,900
I can't imagine.
I ask you both...

980
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:50,151
...since you grew up with him...

981
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:53,029
...and have been close
to him and his personality...

982
00:58:53,197 --> 00:58:55,698
...to stay here at our court...
...for a little while, so with your company

983
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:58,284
you can cheer him up and find out...
...if there's anything unknown to us

984
00:58:58,452 --> 00:59:04,457
that's bothering him...
...that, once revealed, we can help with.

985
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:06,667
Good gentlemen,
he has talked a lot about you...

986
00:59:06,835 --> 00:59:09,253
...and I'm sure there are no two people
he cares about more.

If you would be so kind

to spend some time with us...
...for the benefit of our hopes...

...your visit will be rewarded
as a king should.

00:59:21,308 --> 00:59:24,477
Both of you could,
by the power you have over us...

991
00:59:24,645 --> 00:59:29,148
...demand rather than ask.
But we both agree,

992
00:59:29,316 --> 00:59:35,363
and we offer ourselves completely...
...to serve you freely

at your command.

Thank you, Guildenstern

Norway, my lord, have returned happily.

01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:13,192
- You've always brought good news.
POLONIUS: Have I, my lord?

1005
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:16,904
Rest assured, my good king,
I hold my duty as dear as my soul...

1006
01:00:17,072 --> 01:00:20,574
...both to my God
and to my gracious king.

1007
01:00:21,118 --> 01:00:23,536
And I believe—

1008
01:00:23,704 --> 01:00:26,914
Unless my mind
no longer follows political matters as well...

1009
01:00:27,082 --> 01:00:28,791
...as it used to.

1010
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:32,837
—that I have discovered
the real reason for Hamlet's madness.

1011
01:00:33,005 --> 01:00:36,632
Oh, tell me that, I really want to hear it.

Let the ambassadors in first.

My news will be the highlight
of this great occasion.

Well, go greet them,
and bring them in.

1015
01:00:45,809 --> 01:00:48,311
He tells me, my dear Gertrude,
that he has found...

1016
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:51,230
...the root cause
of your son's troubles.

1017
01:00:51,398 --> 01:00:53,816
I suspect it's nothing but the obvious...

1018
01:00:53,984 --> 01:00:57,236
...his father's death
and our rushed marriage.

1019

Well, we'll get to the bottom of it.

CLAUDIUS:
Welcome, my good friends.

1021
01:01:17,466 --> 01:01:20,343
Tell me, Voltemand,
what's the news from our brother Norway?

1022
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:24,347
A very positive return of greetings and intentions.

1023
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:29,060
At first, he sent orders to stop
his nephew's troops...

1024
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:33,481
...which seemed to him
to be preparing against the Poles.

1025
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:38,903
But upon closer inspection, he realized
it was against Your Highness.

1026
01:01:39,071 --> 01:01:43,449
Upset by this,
that his illness, age, and weakness...

1027
01:01:43,617 --> 01:01:46,619
...were being used as an excuse,
he sent out orders...

1028
01:01:46,787 --> 01:01:53,292
...to arrest Fortinbras, which he quickly obeyed,
received a reprimand from Norway...

1029
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:57,880
...and, in the end,
promised his uncle never again...

1030
01:01:58,048 --> 01:02:01,634
...to raise arms
against Your Majesty.

1031
01:02:01,802 --> 01:02:05,846
As a result, Old Norway,
overjoyed...

1032
01:02:06,014 --> 01:02:09,975
...gave him 3000 crowns annually...

1033
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:12,978
...and the authority
to use those soldiers...

1034
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:16,399
...as previously gathered,
against the Poles...

1035
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:20,111
...with a request further detailed here...

1036
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:25,324
...that you allow safe passage
through your lands for this mission...

1037
01:02:25,492 --> 01:02:31,330
...with the conditions of safety and approval
as outlined.

1038
01:02:31,498 --> 01:02:33,499
We are pleased with this.

1039
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:38,754
And at a more convenient time, we'll read,
respond, and consider this matter.

1040
01:02:38,922 --> 01:02:41,674
Meanwhile, we thank you
for your efforts.

1041
01:02:41,842 --> 01:02:43,342
Go rest.

1042
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:46,971
Tonight we'll celebrate together.
Welcome back home.

1043
01:02:47,139 --> 01:02:49,056
This matter is well resolved.

1044
01:02:49,433 --> 01:02:55,729
My lord and madam, to discuss
what majesty should be, what duty is...

1045
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:59,984
...why day is day, night is night,
and time is time...

1046
01:03:00,152 --> 01:03:03,737
...would be nothing but wasting
night, day, and time.

1047
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:06,866
Therefore, since being brief
is the essence of intelligence...

1048
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:10,453
...and long-windedness the unnecessary details...
...I will be brief.

1049
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,371
Your noble son is insane.

1050
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,876

1051
01:03:17,419 --> 01:03:22,756
"Madness" is what I call it, because what else is madness but being mad?
But let's move on.

1052
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:26,010
- Get to the point with less embellishment.
Madam, I promise I'm not using any embellishment.

1053
01:03:26,178 --> 01:03:28,888
It's true that he's mad.

1054
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:31,474
It's a shame, and a shame it's true.

1055
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:34,810
A silly expression,

1056
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:40,274
but let's leave it, as I won't use embellishment.
Let's agree he's mad, then.

1057
01:03:40,442 --> 01:03:42,193
And now we need to

1058
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,362
find out what's causing this.
Or better yet, "what's causing this flaw,"

1059
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:50,910
because this flawed effect has a cause.
So that's where we are, and here's what's left.

1060
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:54,914
Consider this.

1061
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:56,665
Ophelia.

1062
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:58,918
I have a daughter—

1063
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:04,298
I have her while she's mine.
—who, in her duty and obedience, listen,

1064
01:04:04,466 --> 01:04:08,719
has given me this.
Now think about it and guess.

1065
01:04:08,887 --> 01:04:10,387
"To...

1066
01:04:12,933 --> 01:04:14,475
...the...

1067
01:04:15,727 --> 01:04:17,269
...heavenly and my soul's idol...

1068
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:22,942
...the most beautiful Ophelia."

1069
01:04:23,944 --> 01:04:28,405
That's a bad phrase, a terrible phrase...

1070
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:30,783
..."beautiful" is a terrible phrase.

1071
01:04:30,951 --> 01:04:32,618
But listen to this.

1072
01:04:32,786 --> 01:04:33,953
"These...

1073
01:04:35,622 --> 01:04:37,289
...in...

1074
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:40,626
...her excellent...

1075
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:44,463
...white bosom, these."

1076
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:48,509
Did this come from Hamlet to her?

1077
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:53,514
Good madam, hold on a moment.

1078
01:04:53,682 --> 01:04:57,017
I'll be honest.
"Doubt the stars are fire,

1079
01:04:57,477 --> 01:05:01,855
doubt the sun moves...
...doubt truth is a liar,

1080
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:05,150
but never doubt I love you."
Dear Ophelia, I'm bad with these words.

1081
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:08,320
I don't have the skill to express my feelings.

1082
01:05:08,488 --> 01:05:10,906
But that I love you most...

1083
01:05:11,074 --> 01:05:13,450
...O most of all, believe it.

1084
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:19,164
Goodbye, goodbye.

1085
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:22,126
Yours forever....

1086
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:28,382
"Most dear lady,

1087
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:32,928
while this body is his, Hamlet."
In obedience,

1088
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:36,015
my daughter has shown me this...
...and more of his advances...

1089
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:38,183
...as they happened over time,

1090
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:40,686
by means, and place...
...all told to me.

1091
01:05:40,854 --> 01:05:42,062
How has she received his love?

1092
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:43,814
- What do you think of me?

1093
01:05:43,982 --> 01:05:47,067
- As a man who is faithful and honorable.
I want to prove that.

1094
01:05:47,235 --> 01:05:48,819
But what would you think,

1095
01:05:48,987 --> 01:05:52,197
when I saw this passionate love developing...
...as I noticed it,

1096
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:54,825
before my daughter told me...
...what would you, or your queen, think

1097
01:05:54,993 --> 01:05:59,163
if I had acted like a piece of furniture?
Or kept my heart

1098
01:05:59,331 --> 01:06:01,415
silent and unresponsive?
Or watched this with idle eyes,

1099
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:04,209
what would you think?
No, I took action,

1100
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:09,048
and I spoke to my young mistress like this:

1101
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:12,551
"Prince Hamlet is way out of your league.
This can't happen."

1102
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:16,305
And then I gave her instructions,
to keep herself away from him...

1103
01:06:16,473 --> 01:06:18,432
...not to allow any messengers,
and accept no gifts.

1104
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:20,768
She followed my advice,
and he, rejected—long story short.

1105
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:25,814
—fell into a depression, then stopped eating...
...then stayed up all night,

1106
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:28,275
then grew weak...
...and eventually, by this decline,

1107
01:06:28,443 --> 01:06:32,404
into the madness he's now in...
...and we're all upset about.

1108
01:06:32,572 --> 01:06:33,572
- Do you think that's the reason?

1109
01:06:35,325 --> 01:06:39,787
- It could be. Seems likely.
Has there ever been a time—

1110
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:42,247
I'd really like to know.
—when I said, "That's the case,"

1111
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:45,000
and it turned out to be wrong?
- Not that I know of.

1112
01:06:45,168 --> 01:06:49,046
- Take this from me if I'm wrong.
If the situation leads me, I'll discover

1113
01:06:49,214 --> 01:06:51,882
where the truth is hidden...
...even if it's buried deep.

1114
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:54,176
How can we investigate further?
You know, sometimes he walks

1115
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:55,803
for four hours straight here in the lobby.

1116
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:59,848
Yes, he does.
At that time,

1117
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:01,433
I'll send my daughter to him.

1118
01:07:01,601 --> 01:07:03,811
You and I should hide behind a curtain.
Watch what happens.

1119
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:06,522
If he doesn't love her
and hasn't lost his mind because of it...

1120
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:10,109
...then I shouldn't be an advisor,
but just run a farm.

1121
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:14,113
- Let's test it.
- But look...

1122
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:15,572
...oh, here comes the poor guy
reading sadly.

1123
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:18,951
Please, both of you, go away.
I'll approach him soon.

1124
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:22,955
Give me a moment.
How are you, my good Lord Hamlet?

1125
01:07:25,417 --> 01:07:26,875
[GASPS]

1126
01:07:30,964 --> 01:07:32,548
Well, thank you.

1127
01:07:32,716 --> 01:07:34,341
Do you recognize me, my lord?

1128
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:40,222
Yes, very well. You're a fish seller.

1129
01:07:44,978 --> 01:07:46,186
- No, I'm not, my lord.

1130
01:07:46,354 --> 01:07:48,814
- Then I wish you were as honest as one.

1131
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:51,900
- Honest, my lord?
- Yes, sir.

1132
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:53,318
Being honest, in this world,
is like being one in 10,000.

1133
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:58,323
That's very true, my lord.
For if the sun breeds maggots

1134
01:07:58,491 --> 01:07:59,742
in a dead dog...

1135
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:02,619
...being a god kissing a corpse.
Do you have a daughter?

1136
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:05,998
I do, my lord.

1137
01:08:07,167 --> 01:08:08,375
Don't let her walk in the sun.

1138
01:08:08,543 --> 01:08:10,002
Conception is a blessing,

1139
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:12,087
but your daughter might conceive...

1140
01:08:12,255 --> 01:08:17,176
Friend...
...be careful.

1141
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:18,927
What do you think of that?

1142
01:08:20,263 --> 01:08:22,097
Still going on about my daughter.

1143
01:08:25,185 --> 01:08:27,019
Yet he didn't recognize me at first.

1144
01:08:27,187 --> 01:08:29,730
He said I was a fish seller.

1145
01:08:29,898 --> 01:08:32,024
He's really gone, really gone.

1146
01:08:32,192 --> 01:08:33,984
And honestly, when I was young,

1147
01:08:34,152 --> 01:08:36,862
I went through a lot because of love...

1148
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:40,532
...almost like this.
I'll talk to him again.

1149
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,701

1150
01:08:43,411 --> 01:08:45,704

1151
01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:48,874
- What are you reading, my lord?
- Just words.

1152
01:08:49,042 --> 01:08:50,751
Words.

1153
01:08:50,919 --> 01:08:54,087
- Words.
- What's the topic, my lord?

1154
01:08:54,255 --> 01:08:56,215
- Between whom?
- I mean, what are you reading about?

1155
01:08:56,382 --> 01:09:01,887
Insults, sir. This sarcastic writer
says here that old men have gray beards...

1156
01:09:02,055 --> 01:09:03,680
...that their faces are wrinkled...

1157
01:09:03,848 --> 01:09:07,351
...their eyes leak thick amber
and plum-tree sap...

1158
01:09:07,519 --> 01:09:11,104
...and that they lack wisdom,
along with having weak legs.

1159
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:13,732
All of which, sir,
although I strongly believe...

1160
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:16,401
...I don't think it's right to write it
down like this.

1161
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:19,196
Because you, sir,
will grow old like me...

1162
01:09:19,364 --> 01:09:23,909
...unless you could walk backward like a crab.

1163
01:09:24,077 --> 01:09:26,370
Though this seems crazy,
there's a method to it.

1164
01:09:26,538 --> 01:09:29,081
- Would you like to come inside, my lord?
- Into my grave?

1165
01:09:29,249 --> 01:09:31,875
Well, that is out of the air.

1166
01:09:33,795 --> 01:09:36,713
Sometimes his responses are so clever.

1167
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:39,299
A kind of luck
that madness often hits on...

1168
01:09:39,467 --> 01:09:43,136
...which reason and sanity can't
deliver so successfully.

1169
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:45,264
I'll leave him and quickly plan...

1170
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:48,767
...a meeting
between him and my daughter.

1171
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:54,690
My lord?

1172
01:09:56,067 --> 01:09:57,776
My lord, I'll be taking my leave now.

1173
01:09:57,944 --> 01:10:01,738
You can't take anything from me, sir,
that I'd be happier to part with.

1174
01:10:02,782 --> 01:10:09,621
Except my life.

1175
01:10:09,789 --> 01:10:11,790
Goodbye, my lord.

1176
01:10:12,125 --> 01:10:14,793
These tiresome old fools.

1177
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:19,590
My honored lord!

1178
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:23,468
You're going to find Lord Hamlet.
There he is.

1179
01:10:29,517 --> 01:10:31,685
My honored lord!

1180
01:10:34,814 --> 01:10:35,814
[CHUCKLING]

1181
01:10:35,982 --> 01:10:36,982
My dearest lord.

1182
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:38,734
HAMLET:
My excellent good friends.

1183
01:10:38,902 --> 01:10:42,195
How are you, Guildenstern?
Rosencrantz?

1184
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:43,614
Good guys, how are you both?

1185
01:10:43,781 --> 01:10:45,657
Like the average people of the world.

1186
01:10:45,825 --> 01:10:49,745
Happy that we're not too happy,
we're not at the top of Fortune's hat.

1187
01:10:49,913 --> 01:10:52,331
- Nor at the bottom of her shoes?
- Neither, my lord.

1188
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:55,000
You're around her waist,
in the middle of her favors?

1189
01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:56,877
Actually, we're in her private parts.

1190
01:10:57,045 --> 01:11:00,464
In Fortune's secret parts? Very true,
she's a whore. What's the news?

1191
01:11:00,632 --> 01:11:03,634
Nothing, my lord,
except the world has become honest.

1192
01:11:03,801 --> 01:11:05,177
Then judgment day is near.

1193
01:11:05,345 --> 01:11:07,971
But your news isn't true.
Let me ask specifically.

1194
01:11:08,139 --> 01:11:11,642
What have you done to deserve
being sent to prison by Fortune?

1195
01:11:11,809 --> 01:11:13,352
- Prison?
- Denmark's a prison.

1196
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:15,228
- Then the world is one.
- A pretty big one.

1197
01:11:15,396 --> 01:11:18,023
With many boundaries,
sections, and cells...

1198
01:11:18,191 --> 01:11:22,069
- ...Denmark being one of the worst.
- We don't think so, my lord.

1199
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:24,196
Well, then it's not one to you...

1200
01:11:24,364 --> 01:11:29,493
...because nothing is good or bad
except how you think about it.

1201
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:30,994
To me, it's like a prison.

1202
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:35,958
Well, your ambition is what makes it feel that way.
It's too small for your mind.

1203
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:38,710
Oh God, I could be confined
in a tiny space...

1204
01:11:38,878 --> 01:11:41,713
...and still think of myself
as a king of endless space...

1205
01:11:41,881 --> 01:11:44,257
...if it weren't for my bad dreams.

1206
01:11:44,425 --> 01:11:46,802
Those dreams are actually ambition.

1207
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:50,305
Because the essence of ambition
is just the shadow of a dream.

1208
01:11:50,473 --> 01:11:51,890
A dream itself is only a shadow.

1209
01:11:52,058 --> 01:11:54,559
And I think ambition
is so light and airy...

1210
01:11:54,727 --> 01:11:56,186
...it's just a shadow's shadow.

1211
01:11:56,354 --> 01:11:58,021
Well, then our beggars are the real people...

1212
01:11:58,189 --> 01:12:01,149
...and our kings and heroes
are just the beggars' shadows.

1213
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:04,945
Shall we go to the court?
Honestly, I can't figure it out.

1214
01:12:05,113 --> 01:12:08,365
- We'll wait for you.
- That's not necessary.

1215
01:12:08,533 --> 01:12:11,910
I won't group you with the rest
of my servants...

1216
01:12:12,078 --> 01:12:17,290
...because, to be honest,
I'm poorly served.

1217
01:12:18,251 --> 01:12:23,422
But as friends,
why are you in Elsinore?

1218
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:25,757
To visit you, my lord. No other reason.

1219
01:12:25,925 --> 01:12:28,301
I'm such a beggar,
I'm even poor in thanks...

1220
01:12:28,469 --> 01:12:30,387
...but thank you.

1221
01:12:30,555 --> 01:12:34,474
And really, dear friends,
my thanks are worth very little.

1222
01:12:35,435 --> 01:12:38,395
Were you sent for?
Is it your own decision?

1223
01:12:38,563 --> 01:12:40,105
Is this a free visit?

1224
01:12:40,273 --> 01:12:43,358
Come on, be honest with me.

1225
01:12:43,526 --> 01:12:45,736
Come on, come on. Speak up.

1226
01:12:45,903 --> 01:12:47,237
What should we say, my lord?

1227
01:12:47,405 --> 01:12:49,489
Anything but the truth!

1228
01:12:49,657 --> 01:12:51,116
You were sent for.

1229
01:12:51,284 --> 01:12:55,037
I can see it in your faces, and
you're not good at hiding it.

1230
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:58,248
- The king and queen sent for you.
- Why, my lord?

1231
01:12:58,416 --> 01:13:00,083
You have to tell me.

1232
01:13:00,251 --> 01:13:02,711
Let me ask you,
by our friendship...

1233
01:13:02,879 --> 01:13:04,546
...by our shared youth...

1234
01:13:04,714 --> 01:13:07,507
...by the bond
of our lasting love...

1235
01:13:07,675 --> 01:13:11,803
...and by anything else
that might compel you...

1236
01:13:11,971 --> 01:13:17,350
...be honest and direct with me
whether you were sent for or not.

1237
01:13:19,312 --> 01:13:22,272
- What do you say?
- Well, then, I've got my eye on you.

1238
01:13:22,815 --> 01:13:26,359
If you care about me, don't hold back.

1239
01:13:27,653 --> 01:13:31,198
My lord, we were sent for.

1240
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:36,870
HAMLET:
I'll tell you why.

1241
01:13:37,038 --> 01:13:39,331
So my guesswork
won't spoil your secret...

1242
01:13:39,499 --> 01:13:44,461
...and you won't lose any favor
with the king and queen.

1243
01:13:45,296 --> 01:13:48,048
Lately, I've--

1244
01:13:48,216 --> 01:13:50,175
But I don't know why.

1245
01:13:50,343 --> 01:13:56,348
--lost all my happiness,
stopped all my usual activities.

1246
01:13:56,516 --> 01:14:00,185
And honestly, it weighs so heavily
on my mood...

1247
01:14:00,353 --> 01:14:05,232
...that this beautiful earth...

1248
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:08,860
...seems like a barren cliff to me.

1249
01:14:09,529 --> 01:14:11,863
This amazing sky, the air...

1250
01:14:12,031 --> 01:14:16,535
...look at it,
this magnificent overhanging sky...

1251
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:20,705
...this magnificent ceiling...

1252
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:23,917
...decorated with golden light.

1253
01:14:24,085 --> 01:14:26,128
Why, it seems to me like nothing more...

1254
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:32,551
...than a disgusting and harmful
collection of vapors.

1255
01:14:34,137 --> 01:14:37,430
What an amazing creation is a human.

1256
01:14:38,015 --> 01:14:39,641
How noble in reasoning...

1257
01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:42,477
...how limitless in abilities...

1258
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:47,899
...in shape and movement
how clear and admirable...

1259
01:14:48,067 --> 01:14:51,736
...in action, how like an angel...

1260
01:14:51,904 --> 01:14:56,449
...in understanding, how like a god...

1261
01:14:56,617 --> 01:14:57,951
...the beauty of the world...

1262
01:14:58,119 --> 01:15:00,245
...the best of all animals.

1263
01:15:00,413 --> 01:15:03,957
And yet, to me...

1264
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:08,587
...what is this essence...

1265
01:15:08,754 --> 01:15:11,506
...of dust?

1266
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:17,596
People don't bring me joy.

1267
01:15:18,181 --> 01:15:22,267
No, not women either,
even though your smile suggests otherwise.

1268
01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:24,644
My lord, I wasn't thinking about that.
Why did you laugh, then,

1269
01:15:24,812 --> 01:15:28,315
when I said, "People don't bring me joy"?
To consider, my lord,

1270
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:32,736
if you don't enjoy people...
...what little entertainment

1271
01:15:32,904 --> 01:15:36,573
the actors will get from you.
We met them on the way and now

1272
01:15:36,741 --> 01:15:40,118
they are coming to offer their services to you.
The one who plays the king will be welcome.

1273
01:15:40,286 --> 01:15:42,412
His Majesty will receive my tribute.

1274
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:45,749
The daring knight

1275
01:15:45,917 --> 01:15:48,752
will use his sword and shield...
...the lover won't sigh for free...

1276
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:50,837
...the funny man

1277
01:15:51,005 --> 01:15:53,465
will finish his part peacefully...
...the clown will make those laugh

1278
01:15:53,633 --> 01:15:57,052
whose lungs are easily amused...
...and the lady will speak her mind freely,

1279
01:15:57,220 --> 01:16:00,931
or the poetry will suffer for it.
What actors are they?

1280
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:03,016
ROSENCRANTZ: The same ones you used to

1281
01:16:03,184 --> 01:16:06,519
enjoy, the city's tragedians.
How come they're traveling?

1282
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:07,938
Their standing, both in reputation

1283
01:16:08,105 --> 01:16:11,608
and profit, was better when they stayed put.
Their restriction comes

1284
01:16:11,776 --> 01:16:14,486
because of recent changes.
Do they still have the same reputation

1285
01:16:14,654 --> 01:16:17,239
they did when I was in the city?
- Are they still popular?

1286
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:19,282
- They are not.
HAMLET:

1287
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:21,409
Well, how did that happen? Are they getting outdated?
Their efforts

1288
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:23,536
remain the same as before.
But there is, sir, a group of children...

1289
01:16:23,704 --> 01:16:25,664
...little performers who shout at the top

1290
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:29,834
of their lungs and get applause for it.
These are now in style...

1291
01:16:30,002 --> 01:16:31,336
...and they criticize the usual stages...

1292
01:16:31,504 --> 01:16:33,588
...so much that many sword-wearers are scared of

1293
01:16:33,756 --> 01:16:37,467
writers and hardly go there.
Are they children? Who supports them?

1294
01:16:37,635 --> 01:16:40,637
How are they funded?
Will they continue acting

1295
01:16:40,805 --> 01:16:44,057
only as long as they can sing?
Won't they later say, if they

1296
01:16:44,225 --> 01:16:47,602
become regular actors—
As is likely,

1297
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:50,021
if their opportunities don't improve.
—that their writers wrong them by making them

1298
01:16:50,189 --> 01:16:54,317
speak against their own future?
Honestly, there's been a lot of fuss

1299
01:16:54,485 --> 01:16:57,028
on both sides.
The nation doesn't see it as wrong

1300
01:16:57,196 --> 01:16:59,906
to provoke them into arguments.

1301
01:17:00,074 --> 01:17:04,160
There wasn't any money offered for the argument
unless the poet and actor started fighting.

1302
01:17:04,328 --> 01:17:06,997
- Is that possible?
- There's been a lot of brainpower wasted.

1303
01:17:07,164 --> 01:17:09,082
And do the boys win in the end?

1304
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:12,919
ROSENCRANTZ: Yes, they do,
my lord, even Hercules and his burden too.

1305
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:14,838
Well, that's not very surprising.

1306
01:17:15,006 --> 01:17:17,048
Because my uncle is the king of Denmark...

1307
01:17:17,216 --> 01:17:20,302
...and those who would mock him
when my father was alive...

1308
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:24,306
...now pay 20, 40, 50, a hundred ducats
each for a small picture of him.

Here come the actors.

1313
01:17:37,570 --> 01:17:39,070
Welcome to Elsinore.

1314
01:17:39,238 --> 01:17:42,157
Shake hands. The custom of welcome
is all about fashion and ceremony.

1315
01:17:42,325 --> 01:17:45,577
Let me greet you in this manner,
so my welcome to the actors—

1316
01:17:45,745 --> 01:17:47,329
Which must be shown outwardly.

1317
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:49,831
—doesn't seem more like entertainment
than yours.

1318
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:52,751
But my uncle-father and aunt-mother
are mistaken.

1319
01:17:52,918 --> 01:17:54,252
In what way, my dear lord?

1320
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:55,837
I'm only crazy when the wind is from the northwest.

1321
01:17:56,005 --> 01:17:59,132
When the wind is from the south,
I can tell a hawk from a handsaw.

POLONIUS:
Farewell, gentlemen.

Listen, Guildenstern, and you too—
One listener for each ear.

1324

—that child isn't
out of his diapers yet.

1325
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:09,267
He's back in them for the second time,
they say an old man becomes a child again.

1326
01:18:09,435 --> 01:18:11,770
I predict he's coming
to tell me about the actors.

1327
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:14,939
You're right, sir, it was Monday morning,
that's when it happened.

POLONIUS:
My lord, I have news for you.

1329
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,527
HAMLET:
My lord, I have news for you.

1330
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:23,656
- When Roscius was an actor in Rome—
- The actors have arrived, my lord.

1331
01:18:23,824 --> 01:18:25,533
- Buzz, buzz.
- On my honor—

1332
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:27,243
Then each actor arrived on a donkey.

1333
01:18:27,411 --> 01:18:30,997
The best actors in the world, whether
for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral...

...pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,
tragical-historical...

...tragical-comical-historical-pastoral,
indivisible scenes, or unlimited poems.

1336
01:18:38,047 --> 01:18:40,382
Seneca can't be too serious,
nor Plautus too lighthearted.

1337
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:43,301
For the rules of writing and creativity,
these are the only men.

1338
01:18:43,469 --> 01:18:46,346
O Jephthah, judge of Israel,
what a treasure you had.

1339
01:18:46,514 --> 01:18:47,972
What treasure did he have, my lord?

1340
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:52,018
Why, "One beautiful daughter and no more,
whom he loved very much."

1341
01:18:52,186 --> 01:18:54,979
- Still talking about my daughter.
- Am I not right, old Jephthah?

1342
01:18:55,147 --> 01:18:58,274
If you call me Jephthah,
I have a daughter that I love very much.

1343
01:18:58,442 --> 01:18:59,984
No, that doesn't follow.

1344
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:01,486
POLONIUS:
What follows then, my lord?

1345
01:19:01,654 --> 01:19:05,156
Why, "As by chance, God knows," and then....

1346
01:19:05,324 --> 01:19:08,660
You know, "It happened,
just as it was likely to."

Welcome, dear friends.

- Oh, my old friend.
- Sir.

1353
01:19:25,845 --> 01:19:28,638
Wow, you've grown a beard
since I last saw you.

1354

Are you here to challenge me
in Denmark, huh?

1355

What, my young lady and mistress.

1356
01:19:34,437 --> 01:19:37,856
By the way, you're closer to heaven
than when I last saw you...

1357
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:39,858
...by the height of a platform shoe.

1358
01:19:40,025 --> 01:19:42,944
I hope your voice,
like a piece of counterfeit gold...

1359
01:19:43,112 --> 01:19:44,863
...isn't cracked.

You're all welcome, everyone.

Come on, show us what you've got.

Come on, a passionate speech.

1364
01:19:57,251 --> 01:19:59,335
What speech, my good lord?

1365
01:19:59,503 --> 01:20:02,881
I remember you gave a speech once,
but it was never performed...

1366
01:20:03,048 --> 01:20:04,549
...or if it was, only once.

1367
01:20:04,717 --> 01:20:07,510
I remember the play
didn't please the masses.

1368
01:20:07,678 --> 01:20:09,804
It was like caviar to the general public.

1369
01:20:09,972 --> 01:20:11,514
But it was-- As I understood it...

1370
01:20:11,682 --> 01:20:15,643
...and others whose opinions
in these matters were better than mine.

1371
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:18,521
--an excellent play,
well-organized in the scenes...

1372
01:20:18,689 --> 01:20:20,690
...written with as much modesty
as skill.

1373
01:20:20,858 --> 01:20:25,069
I remember someone said there were no jokes
in the lines to make it entertaining...

1374
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:26,988
...nor any pretentious language...

1375
01:20:27,156 --> 01:20:30,241
...that might accuse
the author of being pretentious...

1376
01:20:30,409 --> 01:20:32,243
...but called it an honest style...

1377
01:20:32,411 --> 01:20:36,331
...as wholesome as it was sweet,
and much more elegant than flashy.

1378
01:20:36,499 --> 01:20:40,585
One speech in it I especially loved,
it was Aeneas' tale to Dido...

1379
01:20:40,753 --> 01:20:44,881
...and particularly the part
where he talks about Priam's murder.

1380
01:20:45,049 --> 01:20:47,425
If you remember it,
start at this line:

1381
01:20:47,593 --> 01:20:51,054
Let me see, let me see:

1382
01:20:52,765 --> 01:20:56,893
The fierce Pyrrhus,
like the Hyrcanian beast--

1383
01:20:57,061 --> 01:20:59,562
- That's not it.
- It starts with Pyrrhus.

1384
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:01,231
It starts with Pyrrhus.

1385
01:21:01,398 --> 01:21:05,193
The fierce Pyrrhus,
whose dark armor...

1386
01:21:05,361 --> 01:21:07,987
...as black as his intentions,
looked like the night...

1387
01:21:08,155 --> 01:21:10,949
...when he lay hidden
in the ominous horse...

1388
01:21:11,116 --> 01:21:14,661
...now has this dreadful
and dark appearance smeared...

1389
01:21:14,828 --> 01:21:17,455
...with even more dreadful symbols.

1390
01:21:17,623 --> 01:21:23,294
- From head to toe, he's now completely red...
ALL: Red.

1391
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:27,924
...horribly covered with the blood of fathers,
mothers, daughters, sons...

1392
01:21:28,092 --> 01:21:30,343
...baked and hardened
by the scorching streets...

1393
01:21:30,511 --> 01:21:34,013
...that cast a tyrannical and cursed light
on their lord's murder.

1394
01:21:34,181 --> 01:21:35,807
Roasted in anger and fire...

1395
01:21:35,975 --> 01:21:38,351
...and thus covered
with thickened blood...

1396
01:21:38,519 --> 01:21:41,479
...with eyes like glowing stones
the hellish Pyrrhus...

1397
01:21:41,647 --> 01:21:45,984
...seeks old grandfather Priam.

1398
01:21:49,572 --> 01:21:51,739
So continue.

1399
01:21:55,327 --> 01:21:59,914
By God, my lord, well-spoken,
with good accent and good judgment.

1400
01:22:01,792 --> 01:22:04,669
Soon he finds him...

1401
01:22:04,837 --> 01:22:07,589
...striking too short at the Greeks.

1402
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:12,885
His old sword, too heavy for him,
lies where it falls...

1403
01:22:13,053 --> 01:22:15,305
...refusing to follow orders.

1404
01:22:15,472 --> 01:22:18,182
An uneven fight,
Pyrrhus charges at Priam...

1405
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:19,767
...and in his anger, misses widely.

1406
01:22:19,935 --> 01:22:22,478
But with the gust and force
of his deadly sword...

1407
01:22:22,646 --> 01:22:24,480
...the weakened father falls.

1408
01:22:24,648 --> 01:22:26,190
Then the city of Troy...

1409
01:22:26,358 --> 01:22:29,527
...seems to feel his blow,
with its burning top...

1410
01:22:29,695 --> 01:22:32,864
...bends to its foundation,
and with a terrible crash...

1411
01:22:33,032 --> 01:22:35,825
...captures Pyrrhus' attention.

1412
01:22:35,993 --> 01:22:38,870
For look, his sword,
which was aimed at the white-haired...

1413
01:22:39,038 --> 01:22:41,873
...Priam,
seemed to hang in the air.

1414
01:22:42,041 --> 01:22:45,543
So like a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood...

1415
01:22:45,711 --> 01:22:49,672
...and like someone undecided,
did nothing.

1416
01:22:49,923 --> 01:22:53,176
But as we often see
before a storm...

1417
01:22:53,344 --> 01:22:57,805
...a calm in the sky,
the clouds stop moving...

1418
01:22:57,973 --> 01:23:00,475
...the strong winds go silent...

1419
01:23:00,643 --> 01:23:06,022
...and the world below is as quiet as death...

1420
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:09,859
...soon the terrifying thunder
tears through the sky.

1421
01:23:10,027 --> 01:23:14,280
So after Pyrrhus' pause,
a renewed vengeance drives him to action.

1422
01:23:14,448 --> 01:23:16,908
And never did the Cyclops' hammers strike...

1423
01:23:17,076 --> 01:23:20,995
...on Mars' armor,
made to last forever...

1424
01:23:21,163 --> 01:23:24,624
...with less pity
than Pyrrhus' bloody sword...

1425
01:23:24,792 --> 01:23:27,168
...now strikes Priam.

1426
01:23:27,378 --> 01:23:30,713
Damn you, fickle Fortune!

1427
01:23:30,881 --> 01:23:34,759
All you gods,
in a grand meeting, take away her power...

1428
01:23:34,927 --> 01:23:38,262
...break all the spokes and rims
from her wheel...

1429
01:23:38,430 --> 01:23:41,724
...and roll the round hub
down the hill of heaven...

1430
01:23:41,892 --> 01:23:43,434
...as low as to the demons!

1431
01:23:44,061 --> 01:23:45,853
This is too long.

1432
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:49,190
It should go to the barber, along with your beard.

1433
01:23:49,358 --> 01:23:50,775
Please, continue.

1434
01:23:50,943 --> 01:23:56,781
He's up for a dance or a dirty joke,
or he'll fall asleep.

1435
01:23:56,949 --> 01:23:58,449
Continue.

1436
01:23:59,243 --> 01:24:00,451
Get to Hecuba.

1437
01:24:00,619 --> 01:24:05,123
But who,
Oh who had seen the veiled queen.

1438
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:07,125
Veiled queen.

1439
01:24:07,292 --> 01:24:09,502
That's good. "Veiled queen" is good.

1440
01:24:11,588 --> 01:24:13,631
Running barefoot back and forth...

1441
01:24:13,799 --> 01:24:17,093
...threatening the flames
with blind tears.

1442
01:24:17,261 --> 01:24:21,097
A rag on that head
where the crown once was...

1443
01:24:21,265 --> 01:24:26,811
...and for a robe,
around her thin and overburdened body...

1444
01:24:26,979 --> 01:24:30,732
...a blanket grabbed in fear.

1445

Anyone who saw this,
with a tongue dipped in venom...

1446
01:24:35,195 --> 01:24:38,656
...against Fortune's rule
would have spoken treason.

1447
01:24:38,824 --> 01:24:42,076
But if the gods themselves
had seen her then...

1448
01:24:42,244 --> 01:24:45,455
...when she saw Pyrrhus
cruelly playing...

1449
01:24:45,622 --> 01:24:49,167
...by hacking with his sword
her husband's body...

1450
01:24:49,334 --> 01:24:51,836
...the immediate outburst of cries
that she made...

01:24:52,004 --> 01:24:55,089
...unless mortal things
don't move them at all...

1452
01:24:55,257 --> 01:24:58,551
...would have made the burning eyes
of heaven shed tears...

1453
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:02,638
...and stirred passion in the gods.

I'll have you finish the rest soon.
Will you make sure the actors are treated well?

Do you hear me? Treat them well...

and brief record of the times.

Treat them according to your own honor

01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:33,993
I'll have these actors perform something
like my father's murder...

1528
01:29:34,161 --> 01:29:39,290
...in front of my uncle. I'll watch his reactions,
I'll probe him deeply.

1529
01:29:39,458 --> 01:29:43,836
If he even flinches, I'll know what to do.

1530
01:29:44,296 --> 01:29:48,591
The ghost I saw
might be the devil...

1531
01:29:48,759 --> 01:29:51,802
...and the devil has the power
to take on a pleasing form.

1532
01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:57,975
Yes, and maybe,
out of my weakness and sadness—

1533
01:29:58,143 --> 01:30:01,979
Since he's very powerful with such spirits.

1534
01:30:02,147 --> 01:30:04,440
—he's tricking me...

1535
01:30:05,734 --> 01:30:08,235
...to damn me.

1536
01:30:09,863 --> 01:30:15,076
I'll need more solid proof than this.

1537
01:30:16,161 --> 01:30:18,704
The play's the thing...

1538
01:30:18,872 --> 01:30:24,043
...where I'll catch the conscience
of the king.

1539
01:30:25,587 --> 01:30:27,671
And can you by no means of conversation...

1540
01:30:27,839 --> 01:30:31,008
...find out from him
why he's acting so confused...

1541
01:30:31,176 --> 01:30:35,346
...disturbing all his peaceful days
with such wild and dangerous madness?

1542
01:30:35,514 --> 01:30:38,265
He does admit
he feels distracted...

1543
01:30:38,433 --> 01:30:40,684
...but he won't say
what the cause is.

1544
01:30:40,852 --> 01:30:43,145
Nor do we find him willing
to be questioned...

1545
01:30:43,313 --> 01:30:46,023
...but with a crafty madness
keeps his distance...

1546
01:30:46,191 --> 01:30:48,526
...when we try to get him
to confess...

1547
01:30:48,693 --> 01:30:49,693
...his true situation.

1548
01:30:49,861 --> 01:30:53,114
- Did he treat you well?
ROSENCRANTZ: Very much like a gentleman.

1549
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:56,659
But with much effort to be friendly.

1550
01:30:56,827 --> 01:31:00,996
He asked few questions, but to our inquiries
he was very open in his replies.

1551
01:31:01,164 --> 01:31:02,790
Did you offer him any entertainment?

1552
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:06,544
Madam, it happened that some actors
crossed our path on the way.

1553
01:31:06,711 --> 01:31:10,381
We told him about them,
and he seemed happy to hear it.

1554
01:31:10,549 --> 01:31:14,301
They're around the court, and they've
already been asked to perform for him.

1555
01:31:14,469 --> 01:31:17,388
POLONIUS: That's true, and he
asked me to request your majesties...

1556
01:31:17,556 --> 01:31:20,516
- ...to watch and listen to the performance.
- Absolutely.

1557
01:31:20,684 --> 01:31:23,227
It makes me very happy
to hear he's interested.

1558
01:31:23,395 --> 01:31:25,271
Good gentlemen,
encourage him further...

1559
01:31:25,438 --> 01:31:28,858
- ...and lead him towards these pleasures.
- We will, my lord.

1560
01:31:30,068 --> 01:31:33,696
Sweet Gertrude, please leave us too...

1561
01:31:33,864 --> 01:31:36,157
...because we've secretly sent
for Hamlet to come here...

1562
01:31:36,324 --> 01:31:40,035
...so that he might, by chance,
meet Ophelia.

1563
01:31:40,203 --> 01:31:44,248
Her father and I, as rightful spies,
will position ourselves...

1564
01:31:44,416 --> 01:31:49,086
...so that, unseen,
we can honestly judge their meeting...

1565
01:31:49,254 --> 01:31:54,216
...and understand from his behavior,
if it's love that's troubling him...

1566
01:31:54,384 --> 01:31:56,760
...causing his suffering.

1567
01:31:57,262 --> 01:31:59,305
I will do as you say.

1568
01:32:00,599 --> 01:32:03,267
And as for you, Ophelia, I hope...

1569
01:32:03,435 --> 01:32:07,479
...that your beauty
is the reason for Hamlet's madness.

1570
01:32:08,148 --> 01:32:13,485
I hope your virtues
will bring him back to his normal self...

1571
01:32:13,653 --> 01:32:15,487
...for both your sakes.

1572
01:32:15,655 --> 01:32:19,033
Madam, I hope so too.

1573
01:32:22,454 --> 01:32:24,914
POLONIUS:
Ophelia, stay here--

1574
01:32:25,081 --> 01:32:27,291
If it pleases you,
we will hide ourselves.

1575
01:32:27,459 --> 01:32:28,542
--read this book...

1576
01:32:28,710 --> 01:32:31,462
...so it looks like
you're alone for a reason.

1577
01:32:31,630 --> 01:32:33,088
We often make this mistake.

1578
01:32:33,256 --> 01:32:36,467
It's too often proven that with
a show of devotion and pious actions...

1579
01:32:36,635 --> 01:32:38,385
...we cover up evil.

1580
01:32:38,553 --> 01:32:40,888
Oh, it's too true.

1581
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:46,310
How that speech
stings my conscience.

1582
01:32:46,478 --> 01:32:49,230
The prostitute's cheek,
made beautiful with makeup...

1583
01:32:49,397 --> 01:32:53,817
...isn't more ugly
compared to what hides it...

1584
01:32:53,985 --> 01:33:00,241
...than my actions
are to my fancy words.

1585
01:33:01,993 --> 01:33:04,161
Oh, what a heavy burden.

1586
01:33:04,329 --> 01:33:07,581
POLONIUS: I hear him coming.
Let's step back, my lord.

1587
01:33:42,617 --> 01:33:48,038
To be, or not to be...

1588
01:33:49,207 --> 01:33:51,625
...that's the question:

1589
01:33:52,711 --> 01:33:55,713
Is it nobler in the mind
to endure...

1590
01:33:55,880 --> 01:34:00,217
...the hardships and misfortunes...
...or to fight back

1591
01:34:00,385 --> 01:34:03,178
against a sea of troubles...
...and by opposing, end them?

1592
01:34:03,346 --> 01:34:05,723
To die, to sleep.

1593
01:34:05,890 --> 01:34:08,642
Nothing more...

1594
01:34:08,810 --> 01:34:10,185
...and by sleeping, to say we end...

1595
01:34:10,353 --> 01:34:13,522
...the heartache

1596
01:34:13,690 --> 01:34:16,984
and the countless natural shocks...
...that flesh is destined to.

1597
01:34:17,152 --> 01:34:19,069
It's an outcome

1598
01:34:19,237 --> 01:34:23,615
devoutly to be wished for.
To die...

1599
01:34:24,451 --> 01:34:26,452
...to sleep.

1600
01:34:26,619 --> 01:34:28,620

1601
01:34:29,497 --> 01:34:31,415
To sleep...

1602
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:33,459
...maybe to dream.

1603
01:34:33,626 --> 01:34:36,045
Yes, there's the catch.

1604
01:34:36,588 --> 01:34:39,006
For in that sleep of death...

1605
01:34:39,174 --> 01:34:42,384
...what dreams might come...

1606
01:34:42,552 --> 01:34:44,970
...when we've left behind
this mortal life...

1607
01:34:45,138 --> 01:34:47,097
...must make us pause.

1608
01:34:47,265 --> 01:34:52,353
That's the thought
that makes us endure life's hardships for so long.

1609
01:34:52,812 --> 01:34:56,899
For who would endure
the beatings and insults of time...

1610
01:34:57,067 --> 01:35:03,030
...the oppressor's wrongs,
the arrogance of the proud...

1611
01:35:03,198 --> 01:35:07,993
...the pain of unreturned love,
the delays of the law...

1612
01:35:08,161 --> 01:35:14,500
...the rudeness of those in power, and the insults
that patient merit receives from the unworthy...

1613
01:35:14,667 --> 01:35:19,296
...when he himself could end his troubles
with a simple dagger?

1614
01:35:19,839 --> 01:35:22,216
Who would carry burdens...

1615
01:35:22,384 --> 01:35:27,429
...to groan and sweat
through a tiring life...

1616
01:35:28,014 --> 01:35:32,309
...except for the fear...

1617
01:35:32,727 --> 01:35:36,647
...of something after death...

1618
01:35:38,483 --> 01:35:41,318
...the undiscovered country...

1619
01:35:41,486 --> 01:35:45,406
...from which no traveler returns...

1620
01:35:45,824 --> 01:35:47,533
...confuses our will...

1621
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:50,702
...and makes us rather endure
the problems we know...

1622
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:53,747
...than rush to others
that we know nothing about?

1623
01:35:53,915 --> 01:35:57,334
So our conscience...

1624
01:35:57,502 --> 01:35:59,211
...makes cowards of us all...

1625
01:35:59,379 --> 01:36:03,340
...and so the natural color of determination...

1626
01:36:03,508 --> 01:36:08,846
...is weakened
by the pale shade of thought...

1627
01:36:09,013 --> 01:36:11,932
...and plans
of great importance and significance...

1628
01:36:12,100 --> 01:36:18,397
...with this in mind
their paths go astray...

1629
01:36:18,565 --> 01:36:21,358
...and lose the name...

1630
01:36:23,611 --> 01:36:24,987
...of action.

Well.

01:37:19,417 --> 01:37:21,001
My lord...

1640
01:37:23,254 --> 01:37:25,547
...I have keepsakes of yours...

1641
01:37:25,715 --> 01:37:28,258
...that I've wanted to return for a long time.

1642
01:37:29,802 --> 01:37:31,345
Please take them back.

1643
01:37:31,513 --> 01:37:32,804
No.

1644
01:37:34,057 --> 01:37:36,225
Not me, I never gave you anything.

1645
01:37:36,434 --> 01:37:38,435
My honored lord...

1646
01:37:39,145 --> 01:37:41,438
...you know very well you did...

1647
01:37:42,607 --> 01:37:44,399
...and with them...

1648
01:37:44,567 --> 01:37:47,611
...words so sweetly composed
that made the things more valuable.

1649

Their scent is gone...

1650
01:37:49,572 --> 01:37:51,490
...take these back.

1651
01:37:52,617 --> 01:37:56,078
For to the noble mind, rich gifts
become worthless when the giver is unkind.

1652
01:37:56,621 --> 01:37:58,288
There, my lord.

1653
01:37:58,623 --> 01:38:02,042
Huh?

1654
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:05,295
- Are you honest?
- My lord?

1655
01:38:05,463 --> 01:38:08,340
- Are you beautiful?
- What do you mean, my lord?

1656
01:38:08,508 --> 01:38:12,511
That if you are honest and beautiful, your honesty
should not allow any conversation with your beauty.

1657
01:38:12,679 --> 01:38:14,596
Can beauty have better dealings
than with honesty?

1658
01:38:14,764 --> 01:38:17,391
Honestly, because the power of beauty
will change honesty...

1659
01:38:17,559 --> 01:38:21,937
...from what it is to something corrupt more easily than honesty
can change beauty into its own likeness.

1660
01:38:22,105 --> 01:38:26,149
This used to be a paradox,
but now time has proven it true.

1661
01:38:32,657 --> 01:38:34,074
I did love you once.

1662
01:38:34,826 --> 01:38:38,036
Indeed, my lord,
you made me believe that.

1663
01:38:38,204 --> 01:38:40,747
Well, you shouldn't have believed me...

1664
01:38:40,915 --> 01:38:44,334
...because virtue cannot so change
our nature that we don't still have a taste for it.

1665
01:38:44,502 --> 01:38:46,003
I didn't love you.

1666
01:38:46,713 --> 01:38:50,299
- I was more deceived.
- Go to a convent.

Why would you want to
give birth to sinners?

1668
01:38:52,552 --> 01:38:53,802
I am reasonably honest...

1669
01:38:53,970 --> 01:38:57,306
...yet I could accuse myself that it would have been better
if my mother had not given birth to me.

1670
01:38:57,473 --> 01:39:01,643
I am proud, vengeful, ambitious, with more
sins than I have thoughts to act them out...

1671
01:39:01,811 --> 01:39:04,479
...imagination to shape them,
or time to carry them out.

What should people like me do
crawling between earth and heaven?

If you do marry,
I'll give you this curse as your dowry:

Be as chaste as ice,
as pure as snow...

was a bit disorganized, wasn't madness.

There's something in his soul
over which his sadness broods...

1727
01:43:13,437 --> 01:43:16,606
...and I fear the outcome
will be dangerous.

To prevent this, I have

He will go to England

Maybe the seas and different countries,
with varied sights...

1731
01:43:26,951 --> 01:43:29,995
...will drive out this settled
matter in his heart...

1732
01:43:30,162 --> 01:43:34,666
...which his mind keeps dwelling on
and makes him unlike himself.

It should work.

1735
01:43:37,837 --> 01:43:40,797
But still, I believe
the start and cause of his sadness...

1736
01:43:40,965 --> 01:43:43,341
...came from neglected love.

...but, if you think it's right, after the play...

1742
01:43:57,899 --> 01:44:00,984
...let his mother speak to him alone
to find out his troubles.

01:44:01,152 --> 01:44:02,485
Let her be direct with him...

...and I'll be listening
to their entire conversation.

If she doesn't find out,
send him to England...

1746
01:44:08,075 --> 01:44:10,827
...or confine him where
you think best.

1747
01:44:10,995 --> 01:44:13,496
It will be done.

1748
01:44:13,664 --> 01:44:19,544
Madness in important people
must not go unwatched.

1749
01:44:41,525 --> 01:44:44,819
Speak the speech, please,
as I taught you:

1750
01:44:44,987 --> 01:44:46,154
Smoothly and naturally.

1751
01:44:46,322 --> 01:44:49,115
But if you just mouth the words,
like many of your actors do...

1752
01:44:49,283 --> 01:44:51,534
...I might as well have the town crier
speak my lines.

1753
01:44:51,702 --> 01:44:55,038
And don't wave your hands around too much
like this...

1754
01:44:55,206 --> 01:44:56,873
...but be gentle with your movements.

1755
01:44:57,041 --> 01:45:01,336
Because in the rush, storm, and
whirlwind of your emotions...

1756
01:45:01,504 --> 01:45:06,883
...you need to develop a calmness
that makes it smooth.

1757
01:45:07,051 --> 01:45:12,389
Oh, it bothers me deeply to hear
a loud, wig-wearing guy...

1758
01:45:12,556 --> 01:45:17,727
...rip a passion to shreds,
making the audience's ears hurt...

1759
01:45:17,895 --> 01:45:20,146
...who mostly
can't understand anything...

1760
01:45:20,314 --> 01:45:23,233
- ...except for confusing gestures and noise.
- My lord.

1761
01:45:23,401 --> 01:45:26,194
I'd have such a person punished
for overacting like Termagant.

1762
01:45:26,362 --> 01:45:29,781
- It's more over-the-top than Herod. Please avoid it.
- I promise, sir.

1763
01:45:29,949 --> 01:45:34,411
And don't be too dull, either,
but let your own judgment guide you.

1764
01:45:34,578 --> 01:45:37,414
Match the action to the word,
and the word to the action...

1765
01:45:37,581 --> 01:45:39,749
...with this important note:

1766
01:45:39,917 --> 01:45:43,878
Don't go beyond
what is natural.

1767
01:45:44,046 --> 01:45:48,675
Because anything overdone
misses the point of acting...

1768
01:45:48,843 --> 01:45:51,136
...which was and still is...

1769
01:45:51,303 --> 01:45:55,807
...to reflect nature...
...to show virtue its true face,

1770
01:45:55,975 --> 01:45:59,477
and mockery its own image...
...and the times we live in

1771
01:45:59,645 --> 01:46:05,025
their true form and pressure.
Now, if you overdo it or do it poorly,

1772
01:46:05,192 --> 01:46:11,281
even if it makes the unskilled laugh...
...it will only upset the wise.

1773
01:46:11,449 --> 01:46:14,784
The opinion of one knowledgeable person

1774
01:46:14,952 --> 01:46:17,579
should, in your consideration...
...outweigh a whole theater full of others.

1775
01:46:17,747 --> 01:46:20,540
Oh, there are actors

1776
01:46:20,708 --> 01:46:24,085
that I've seen perform...
...and heard others praise,

1777
01:46:24,253 --> 01:46:27,881
highly, without exaggeration...
...who neither have

1778
01:46:28,049 --> 01:46:30,425
the accent of Christians...
...nor the walk of a Christian,

1779
01:46:30,593 --> 01:46:33,678
pagan, or human...
...who strutted and shouted so much...

1780
01:46:33,846 --> 01:46:36,056
...that I thought some

1781
01:46:36,223 --> 01:46:39,267
of nature's apprentices had made humans...
...and hadn't done a good job,

1782
01:46:39,435 --> 01:46:42,645
they mimicked humanity so badly.
I hope we've somewhat improved that here.

1783
01:46:42,813 --> 01:46:45,273
Oh, fix it completely.
And let those who play the clowns

1784
01:46:45,441 --> 01:46:47,150
stick to their lines.

1785
01:46:47,318 --> 01:46:53,448
Because there are some
who will laugh themselves...

1786
01:46:53,616 --> 01:46:55,992
...to get a few
simple-minded spectators to laugh too...

1787
01:46:56,160 --> 01:46:59,913
...even though at the same time
some important part of the play...

1788
01:47:00,081 --> 01:47:05,335
...needs to be considered.
That's terrible...

1789
01:47:05,503 --> 01:47:06,795
...and shows a pathetic ambition

1790
01:47:06,962 --> 01:47:08,338
in the fool who does it.

1791
01:47:08,506 --> 01:47:12,967
Go get ready.
How are you, my lord?

1792
01:47:13,135 --> 01:47:15,428
Will the king watch this performance?

1793
01:47:19,850 --> 01:47:22,393
- And the queen too, and right away.
- Tell the actors to hurry.

1794
01:47:22,561 --> 01:47:26,481
Will you two help speed them up?
- We will, my lord.

1795
01:47:27,191 --> 01:47:28,942
- We will, my lord.

1796
01:47:29,110 --> 01:47:31,069
- Hey, Horatio.
- Here, dear lord, at your service.

1797
01:47:34,782 --> 01:47:37,909
Horatio, you're as honest a man
as I've ever met.

1798
01:47:38,077 --> 01:47:42,288
- Oh, my dear lord--
- No, don't think I'm flattering you.

1799
01:47:42,456 --> 01:47:45,875
Because what advantage
could I gain from you...

1800
01:47:46,043 --> 01:47:48,169

1801
01:47:48,337 --> 01:47:52,841
...that you have no income except your good spirits
to sustain and dress you?

1802
01:47:54,051 --> 01:47:56,803
Why should the poor be praised?

1803
01:47:59,348 --> 01:48:01,933
No, let the sweet-talking tongue
flatter ridiculous grandeur...

1804
01:48:02,101 --> 01:48:05,019
...and bend the willing knee
in submission...

1805
01:48:05,187 --> 01:48:07,313
...where flattery might bring profit.

1806
01:48:07,481 --> 01:48:09,065
Do you hear me?

1807
01:48:09,233 --> 01:48:11,526
Since my dear soul
had the power to choose...

1808
01:48:11,694 --> 01:48:15,321
...and could distinguish between men, her choice
she has chosen you for herself.

1809
01:48:15,489 --> 01:48:18,616
For you have been like someone,
enduring everything, yet suffering nothing...

1810
01:48:18,784 --> 01:48:22,871
...a man who takes life's blows and rewards
with equal gratitude.

1811
01:48:23,038 --> 01:48:28,168
And blessed are those whose emotions
and judgment are so well balanced...

1812
01:48:28,335 --> 01:48:31,588
...that they aren't just an instrument
for Fortune's whims...

1813
01:48:31,755 --> 01:48:33,965
...to play whatever tune she wants.

1814
01:48:34,133 --> 01:48:39,387
Give me a man
who isn't a slave to his emotions...

1815
01:48:39,555 --> 01:48:43,600
...and I'll hold him
close to my heart...

1816
01:48:43,767 --> 01:48:48,688
...yes, in the core of my heart...

1817
01:48:49,899 --> 01:48:52,108
...just like I do with you.

1818
01:48:56,280 --> 01:48:58,323
I've said a bit too much about this.

1819
01:48:58,490 --> 01:49:01,242
There's a play tonight in front of the king.

1820
01:49:01,410 --> 01:49:05,663
One scene is similar to the story
I told you about my father's death.

1821
01:49:05,831 --> 01:49:07,832
I ask you, when you see
that scene begin...

1822
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:11,961
...with your very soul
watch my uncle.

1823
01:49:12,129 --> 01:49:17,217
If his hidden guilt
doesn't reveal itself in one speech...

1824
01:49:17,384 --> 01:49:19,552
...then the ghost we saw
is damned...

1825
01:49:19,720 --> 01:49:23,139
...and my thoughts are as dirty
as Vulcan's forge.

1826
01:49:23,307 --> 01:49:27,435
Pay close attention to him,
because I'll be watching his face closely...

1827
01:49:27,603 --> 01:49:32,649
...and afterward, we'll both share our opinions
on how he seemed.

1828
01:49:32,816 --> 01:49:34,651
Okay, my lord.

1829
01:49:35,653 --> 01:49:38,738
If he does anything suspicious
while this play is happening...

1830
01:49:38,906 --> 01:49:41,115
...and gets away with it...

1831
01:49:41,283 --> 01:49:43,451

You vile mix
of midnight herbs gathered...

1982
01:58:45,869 --> 01:58:49,538
...with Hecate's curse
thrice cast, thrice infected...

1983
01:58:49,706 --> 01:58:52,708
...your natural magic and terrible power...

1984
01:58:52,876 --> 01:58:56,337
...take over healthy life immediately.

1985
01:58:56,505 --> 01:58:59,548
He poisons him in the garden
for his wealth.

1986
01:58:59,716 --> 01:59:00,925
His name is Gonzago.

1987
01:59:01,092 --> 01:59:03,469
The story is well-known,
and written in excellent Italian.

1988
01:59:03,637 --> 01:59:09,225
You'll soon see how the murderer
wins the love of Gonzago's wife!

[GASPS]

1990
01:59:14,564 --> 01:59:16,106
OPHELIA:
The king is getting up.

1991
01:59:16,274 --> 01:59:19,235
What, scared by a fake fire?

1992
01:59:19,402 --> 01:59:22,071
- How is my lord doing?
- Stop the play.

1993
01:59:27,953 --> 01:59:29,787
Give me some light.

1994
01:59:32,457 --> 01:59:33,791

01:59:41,591 --> 01:59:42,675
Horatio!

1998
01:59:44,761 --> 01:59:48,430
Well, let the wounded deer cry...

1999
01:59:48,598 --> 01:59:50,599
...while the unhurt one plays...

2000
01:59:50,767 --> 01:59:53,519
...because some must stay awake,
while others must sleep...

2001
01:59:53,687 --> 01:59:55,688
...and so the world goes on.

Wouldn't this, sir, and a bunch of fancy feathers,
if my luck changes...

...with two fancy roses
on my worn-out shoes...

...get me a spot in a group of actors?

2005
02:00:04,072 --> 02:00:05,698
- Half a share.
- A full one, I say.

2006
02:00:05,866 --> 02:00:07,741
You know, dear Damon...

2007
02:00:07,909 --> 02:00:11,787
...this kingdom was stripped
of Jove himself...

2008
02:00:11,955 --> 02:00:14,832
...and now a real show-off rules here.
a very, very peacock.

2009
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:16,375
You could have made it rhyme.

2010
02:00:16,543 --> 02:00:21,213
Oh, good Horatio, I'll trust the ghost's word
for a thousand pounds.

2011
02:00:21,381 --> 02:00:23,215
- Did you notice?
- Yes, very well, my lord.

2012
02:00:23,383 --> 02:00:25,509
During the talk about the poisoning?

2013
02:00:25,677 --> 02:00:29,221
I watched him closely.

2014
02:00:29,389 --> 02:00:30,556
Ah.

2015
02:00:31,766 --> 02:00:34,059
Come on, let's have some music, bring the recorders.

2016
02:00:34,227 --> 02:00:37,855
Because if the king doesn't like the play,
then he just doesn't like it, indeed.

2017
02:00:38,023 --> 02:00:40,149
Come on, let's have some music.

2018
02:00:41,026 --> 02:00:43,152
- Can I have a word with you?
- A whole story.

2019
02:00:43,320 --> 02:00:44,653
- The king, sir--
- What's up with him?

2020
02:00:44,821 --> 02:00:46,947
Is in his room
very upset.

2021
02:00:47,115 --> 02:00:48,991
- From drinking, sir?
- No, more like anger.

2022
02:00:49,159 --> 02:00:51,660
You should let
his doctor know about this.

2023
02:00:51,828 --> 02:00:55,372
Because if I try to calm him down
it might just make him angrier.

2024
02:00:55,540 --> 02:00:59,001
Get your thoughts organized,
and don't stray so far from my issue.

2025
02:00:59,169 --> 02:01:02,421
I'm calm, sir. Go ahead.

2026
02:01:02,589 --> 02:01:06,967
The queen, your mother, is very
upset and has sent me to you.

2027
02:01:07,135 --> 02:01:10,262
- You're welcome.
- No, this isn't the right kind of courtesy.

2028
02:01:10,430 --> 02:01:13,807
If you give me a proper answer,
I'll do what your mother asked.

2029
02:01:13,975 --> 02:01:17,019
If not, I'll just leave
and that'll be it.

2030
02:01:17,187 --> 02:01:19,480
But, sir, I can't.

2031
02:01:19,648 --> 02:01:22,232
- What, my lord?
- Give you a proper answer.

2032
02:01:22,400 --> 02:01:24,151
My mind's not well.

2033
02:01:24,319 --> 02:01:27,863
But, sir, whatever answer I can give,
you shall have...

2034
02:01:28,031 --> 02:01:30,866
...or rather, as you say, my mother will.

2035

So let's get to the point.

2036

My mother, you say?

2037
02:01:36,039 --> 02:01:37,915
Then this is what she says:

2038
02:01:38,083 --> 02:01:41,085
Your behavior has left her
amazed and in awe.

2039
02:01:41,252 --> 02:01:44,004
Oh, wonderful son,
who can so surprise a mother.

2040
02:01:44,172 --> 02:01:47,549
But is there more to follow
this mother's amazement? Tell me.

2041
02:01:47,717 --> 02:01:50,552
She wants to speak with you
in her room before you go to bed.

We'll obey,

Do you have any other business with us?

- My lord, you once loved me.
- And I still do, by these hands.

Good my lord,
what's causing your upset?

2046
02:02:05,527 --> 02:02:09,113
You lock yourself away
if you don't share your troubles with friends.

2047
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:11,824
Sir, I lack opportunities.

2048
02:02:11,992 --> 02:02:15,703
How can that be when the king himself
supports you for the throne?

2049
02:02:15,870 --> 02:02:19,081
Yes, sir, but "while the grass grows...."

Why are you trying to
get the upper hand on me...

2053
02:02:26,548 --> 02:02:28,674
...as if you want to trap me?

2054
02:02:28,842 --> 02:02:33,053
Oh my lord, if I'm being too forward,
it's because I care too much.

2055
02:02:33,221 --> 02:02:36,765
I don't really understand that.
Will you play this flute?

2056
02:02:36,933 --> 02:02:38,350
- My lord, I can't.
- Please.

2057
02:02:38,518 --> 02:02:40,978

- It's as easy as lying.

02:02:44,357 --> 02:02:46,608
Just cover these holes
with your fingers and thumb.

2060
02:02:46,776 --> 02:02:50,154
Blow into it and it will play
beautiful music. These are the keys.

2061

But I can't make it produce
any music. I don't have the skill.

...you want to uncover
my mysteries...

to my highest.

Do you see that cloud over there
that's almost shaped like a camel?

2073

By God, it does look like a camel.

2074

- It looks like a weasel.
- With a back like a weasel.

- Or like a whale.

- "Soon" is easy to say.

...such a dangerous risk as his madness
keeps growing.

We'll take care of it ourselves.

2086

It's a holy and important duty
to keep all those people safe...

...who live and depend on Your Majesty.

2088
02:04:28,503 --> 02:04:32,381
An individual's life is protected
by all the strength and defenses of the mind...

2089
02:04:32,549 --> 02:04:35,175
...to keep itself safe.

But even more so...

2091

...the spirit on which
many lives depend...

2092

...must be protected.

2093

The fall of a king doesn't happen alone...

2094
02:04:44,185 --> 02:04:46,895
...but like a whirlpool, it pulls
everything nearby with it.

2095
02:04:47,063 --> 02:04:49,940
It's like a massive wheel
on top of the highest mountain...

2096
02:04:50,108 --> 02:04:53,735
...with thousands of
smaller things attached to it...

2097

...which, when it falls...

2098
02:04:55,321 --> 02:04:57,573
...every small attachment,
every little consequence...

2099
02:04:57,740 --> 02:05:00,409
...gets caught in the chaotic destruction.

2100
02:05:00,577 --> 02:05:04,204
The king never sighs alone,
but with a collective groan.

2101
02:05:04,372 --> 02:05:06,748
Arm yourself, please,
for this quick journey...

2102
02:05:06,916 --> 02:05:10,544
...because we will put restraints on this fear
that is currently too free.

to listen in.

2106
02:05:19,846 --> 02:05:23,348
I'm sure she'll confront him directly.
And, as you said—And it was wisely said.

2107
02:05:23,516 --> 02:05:25,934
—it's appropriate that someone else
besides his mother...

2108
02:05:26,102 --> 02:05:29,479
...since mothers are naturally biased,
should overhear the conversation.

2109
02:05:29,647 --> 02:05:30,772
Goodbye, my king.

2110
02:05:30,940 --> 02:05:33,400
I'll check in before you go to bed,
and tell you what I find out.

2111
02:05:33,568 --> 02:05:35,152
Thanks, dear lord.

2112
02:05:35,570 --> 02:05:37,654
It's now
the very witching hour of night...

2113
02:05:37,822 --> 02:05:41,074
...when graveyards open,
and hell itself breathes out...

2114
02:05:41,242 --> 02:05:42,910
...its poison into the world.

2115
02:05:43,077 --> 02:05:46,079
Now I could drink hot blood...

2116
02:05:46,247 --> 02:05:50,667
...and do such terrible deeds that daylight
would be afraid to see them.

2117
02:05:50,835 --> 02:05:54,963
Calm down, now to my mother.

2118
02:05:55,131 --> 02:05:57,090
Oh heart, don't lose your nature.

2119
02:05:57,258 --> 02:06:00,886
Don't let
the spirit of Nero enter this strong heart.

2120
02:06:01,054 --> 02:06:04,389
Let me be harsh, but not inhuman.

2121
02:06:04,557 --> 02:06:08,644
I'll speak sharply to her, but won't harm her.

2122
02:06:08,811 --> 02:06:10,562
My words and soul...

2123
02:06:10,897 --> 02:06:12,481
...will be hypocrites in this.

2124
02:06:12,649 --> 02:06:16,777
No matter how harshly I speak to her...

2125
02:06:16,945 --> 02:06:22,115
...I will never let my soul
agree to act on it.

2126
02:06:22,283 --> 02:06:24,826
Oh, my crime is foul.

2127
02:06:25,078 --> 02:06:27,454
It reeks to heaven.

2128
02:06:27,789 --> 02:06:31,041
It has the oldest curse on it...

...a brother's murder.

2130
02:06:34,462 --> 02:06:35,587
I can't pray.

2131

Even though I want to as much as I can...

2132
02:06:39,467 --> 02:06:43,303
...my stronger guilt
defeats my strong intention.

2133
02:06:43,471 --> 02:06:48,183
And like a man with two tasks,
I hesitate on where to start...

2134
02:06:48,351 --> 02:06:50,602
...and end up doing neither.

2135
02:06:51,688 --> 02:06:56,984
What if this cursed hand were covered
with my brother's blood...

...isn't there enough rain
in the sweet heavens...

...to wash it white as snow?

2138
02:07:01,906 --> 02:07:06,910
What is mercy for
if not to face the face of sin?

2139
02:07:07,078 --> 02:07:13,000
And what's prayer but this double power,
to prevent us from falling...

2140
02:07:13,167 --> 02:07:16,253
...or to forgive us when we're down?

2141
02:07:16,587 --> 02:07:18,422
Then I'll look up.

2142

My sin is done.

2143
02:07:22,093 --> 02:07:26,430
But, oh, what kind of prayer
can help me now?

2144
02:07:26,723 --> 02:07:29,558
"Forgive me my terrible murder"?

2145
02:07:29,726 --> 02:07:31,601
That can't be...

2146
02:07:31,769 --> 02:07:35,522
...since I still have
the things I killed for:

...and my queen.

Can someone be forgiven
and keep the crime?

2150
02:07:47,577 --> 02:07:49,911
In the corrupt ways of this world...

2151
02:07:50,079 --> 02:07:53,081
...a guilty person's wealth
can sometimes bypass justice...

2152
02:07:53,249 --> 02:07:58,170
...and often we see that the wicked gains
can buy their way out of the law.

2153
02:07:58,671 --> 02:08:01,006
But it's not like that in heaven.

2154

There's no trickery there...

...where actions are seen
for what they truly are...

...and we are forced...

...to face
the full extent of our faults...

2158

...and give evidence against ourselves.

2159

What now? What's left to do?

2160
02:08:17,940 --> 02:08:21,943
Try to see what repentance can achieve.
What can't it do?

2161

But what can it do if one can't repent?

2162
02:08:30,536 --> 02:08:34,539
Oh, miserable state,
Oh heart as dark as death...

2163
02:08:34,707 --> 02:08:40,128
...Oh trapped soul that struggles to be free

02:15:35,211 --> 02:15:39,714
...since even frost burns actively,
and reason serves desire.

2281
02:15:39,882 --> 02:15:43,426
Oh, Hamlet, stop speaking.
You turn my eyes into my very soul...

2282
02:15:43,594 --> 02:15:45,929
...and there I see
such dark and deep stains...

2283
02:15:46,096 --> 02:15:47,639
...that won't wash away.

2284
02:15:47,807 --> 02:15:51,351
No, but to live
in the sweaty filth of a stained bed...

2285
02:15:51,519 --> 02:15:55,563
...stewed in corruption, sweetening
and making love over the disgusting mess!

2286
02:15:55,731 --> 02:16:00,109
Oh, stop speaking to me!
These words pierce my ears like daggers.

2287
02:16:00,277 --> 02:16:02,028
No more, dear Hamlet.

2288
02:16:02,196 --> 02:16:03,404
A murderer and a villain...

2289
02:16:03,572 --> 02:16:08,827
...a servant not worth a twentieth
of your previous lord, a mockery of kings...

2290
02:16:08,994 --> 02:16:11,329
...a thief of the empire and the rule...

2291
02:16:11,497 --> 02:16:15,750
...who stole the precious crown
from a shelf and put it in his pocket.

2292
02:16:16,210 --> 02:16:19,879
- No more.
- A king of rags and patches.

2293
02:16:28,722 --> 02:16:29,931
Save me...

2294
02:16:30,307 --> 02:16:33,726
...and protect me with your wings,
you heavenly guards.

What does your noble form want?

2296
02:16:37,106 --> 02:16:38,481
Alas, he's mad.

2297
02:16:38,649 --> 02:16:43,194
Aren't you here
to scold your slow son...

2298
02:16:43,529 --> 02:16:47,448
...who, lost in time and emotion,
lets slip by...

2299
02:16:47,616 --> 02:16:52,370
...the important task
of your fearful command?

2300
02:16:52,746 --> 02:16:53,997
Oh, speak.

[WHISPERS]
Don't forget.

2302
02:16:57,084 --> 02:17:01,462
This visit is just to sharpen...

2303
02:17:01,630 --> 02:17:05,800
...your almost dulled purpose.

2304
02:17:05,968 --> 02:17:07,969
But look...

2305
02:17:08,137 --> 02:17:12,015
...your mother is in shock.

2306
02:17:12,182 --> 02:17:17,729
Step between her and her troubled soul.

2307
02:17:17,897 --> 02:17:22,150
Imagination in the weakest bodies...

2308
02:17:22,318 --> 02:17:25,653
...works the strongest.

2309
02:17:25,821 --> 02:17:28,573
Talk to her, Hamlet.

2310
02:17:28,991 --> 02:17:31,618
How are you, my lady?

2311
02:17:31,785 --> 02:17:34,162
Oh, what's wrong with you...

2312
02:17:34,330 --> 02:17:36,706
...that you stare
at nothing...

2313
02:17:36,874 --> 02:17:40,710
...and talk
to thin air?

2314

Your eyes
show your wild thoughts.

2315
02:17:44,882 --> 02:17:46,966
Like soldiers waking up
to an alarm...

2316
02:17:47,134 --> 02:17:50,720
...your hair stands on end,
like it's alive.

2317
02:17:51,138 --> 02:17:53,306
Oh, dear son...

2318
02:17:53,474 --> 02:17:58,895
...in your heated state,
calm down.

What are you looking at?

2320
02:18:04,234 --> 02:18:09,530
At him.

2321
02:18:10,699 --> 02:18:13,076
See how pale he looks.

2322
02:18:13,243 --> 02:18:18,206
His form and purpose together,
preaching to stones...

2323
02:18:18,374 --> 02:18:19,874
...would make them understand.

2324
02:18:20,709 --> 02:18:22,335
Don't look at me...

2325
02:18:22,503 --> 02:18:26,965
...or your sad expression will change
my harsh intentions.

2326
02:18:27,132 --> 02:18:30,218
Then what I need to do
will lose its true meaning.

2327
02:18:30,386 --> 02:18:32,804
Tears might replace blood.

2328
02:18:32,972 --> 02:18:35,515
- Who are you talking to?
- Do you see anything there?

2329
02:18:35,683 --> 02:18:37,892
Nothing at all, yet I see everything.

2330
02:18:38,060 --> 02:18:40,228
- Did you hear anything?
- Just us.

2331
02:18:40,396 --> 02:18:42,647
Look there! See how it slips away!

2332
02:18:42,815 --> 02:18:45,066
My father, dressed as he was in life!

2333
02:18:45,234 --> 02:18:47,568
Look, there he goes, right now,
out the door.

2334
02:18:47,903 --> 02:18:50,780
This is just your imagination.

2335
02:18:50,948 --> 02:18:54,826
This creation without a body
is what madness is good at.

2336
02:18:54,994 --> 02:18:57,120
Madness.

2337
02:19:02,376 --> 02:19:07,422
My pulse, like yours,
beats steadily...

2338
02:19:07,589 --> 02:19:09,590
...and sounds healthy.

2339
02:19:09,758 --> 02:19:12,301
What I said isn't madness.

2340
02:19:12,469 --> 02:19:15,722
Test me,
and I'll repeat it...

2341
02:19:15,889 --> 02:19:17,682
...which madness would avoid.

2342
02:19:17,850 --> 02:19:20,643
Mother, for the love of grace...

2343
02:19:20,811 --> 02:19:24,105
...don't flatter yourself
by thinking...

2344
02:19:24,273 --> 02:19:28,484
...that it's my madness speaking,
not your wrongdoing.

2345
02:19:28,652 --> 02:19:32,113
It will just cover up
the sore spot...

2346
02:19:32,281 --> 02:19:37,076
...while hidden corruption inside
spreads unnoticed.

2347
02:19:37,244 --> 02:19:39,245
Confess to heaven.

2348
02:19:39,413 --> 02:19:42,582
Repent for the past,
avoid what's coming...

2349
02:19:42,750 --> 02:19:45,251
...and don't spread
fertilizer on the weeds...

2350
02:19:45,419 --> 02:19:47,462
...to make them grow worse.

2351
02:19:47,629 --> 02:19:49,714
Forgive me for my virtue...

2352
02:19:49,882 --> 02:19:55,595
...because in these indulgent times
even virtue has to ask vice for forgiveness...

2353
02:19:55,763 --> 02:19:59,098
...yes, restrain and persuade
to do something good for him.

2354
02:19:59,266 --> 02:20:01,059
Oh, Hamlet.

2355
02:20:02,811 --> 02:20:05,438
You've broken my heart in two.

2356
02:20:05,606 --> 02:20:10,610
Throw away the worse part of it,
and live with the better half.

Good night.

2358
02:20:12,529 --> 02:20:15,323
But don't go to my uncle's bed.

2359
02:20:15,491 --> 02:20:17,909
Pretend to have a virtue if you don't.

2360
02:20:18,077 --> 02:20:20,870
That habit,
which destroys all sense...

2361
02:20:21,038 --> 02:20:23,331
...of the devil's habits, is still an angel in this...

2362
02:20:23,499 --> 02:20:28,211
...because it can make good actions
seem natural...

2363
02:20:28,378 --> 02:20:30,004
...when put on properly.

2364
02:20:30,172 --> 02:20:32,840
Hold back tonight,
and it will make it easier...

2365
02:20:33,008 --> 02:20:35,134
...to abstain next time.
The next time will be easier.

2366
02:20:35,552 --> 02:20:38,012
Because practice can almost change
your natural tendencies...

2367
02:20:38,180 --> 02:20:39,680
...and either shame the devil...

2368
02:20:40,057 --> 02:20:42,642
...or get rid of him
with great power.

2369
02:20:43,852 --> 02:20:45,561
Once more, good night.

2370
02:20:46,063 --> 02:20:49,232
And when you want to be blessed...

2371
02:20:50,442 --> 02:20:53,361
...I'll ask for your blessing.

2372
02:20:54,863 --> 02:20:57,532
I regret what happened to this lord.

2373
02:20:57,699 --> 02:21:02,161
But heaven has decided
to punish me with this, and this with me...

2374
02:21:02,329 --> 02:21:06,207
...so I must be their instrument
and servant.

2375
02:21:07,167 --> 02:21:09,252
I will take care of him...

2376
02:21:10,129 --> 02:21:13,464
...and will justify
the death I caused him.

2377
02:21:14,842 --> 02:21:17,093
So again, good night.

2378
02:21:18,470 --> 02:21:21,889
I have to be cruel to be kind.

2379
02:21:22,558 --> 02:21:25,143
This is the start of the bad...

2380
02:21:25,894 --> 02:21:27,895
...and worse is yet to come.

2381
02:21:29,231 --> 02:21:31,983
One more thing, good lady.

2382
02:21:32,151 --> 02:21:33,734
What should I do?

2383
02:21:33,902 --> 02:21:37,655
Not this, by any means, that I ask you to do:

2384
02:21:38,157 --> 02:21:41,033
Let the bloated king
tempt you back to bed...

2385
02:21:41,201 --> 02:21:43,202
...playfully pinch your cheek...

2386
02:21:43,370 --> 02:21:46,914
...call you his pet, and let him,
for a couple of dirty kisses...

2387
02:21:47,082 --> 02:21:49,667
...or touching your neck
with his cursed fingers...

2388
02:21:49,835 --> 02:21:54,005
...make you reveal everything,
that I'm not truly mad...

2389
02:21:54,173 --> 02:21:57,300
...but pretending.

2390
02:21:57,467 --> 02:22:00,094
It would be good if you let him know.

2391
02:22:00,262 --> 02:22:04,932
For who, being a queen,
beautiful, sober, wise...

2392
02:22:05,100 --> 02:22:08,019
...would hide such important things
from a toad, a bat, a cat...

2393
02:22:08,187 --> 02:22:10,062
...like these?

2394
02:22:10,230 --> 02:22:11,564
Who would do that? No...

2395
02:22:11,732 --> 02:22:13,649
...despite common sense and secrecy...

2396
02:22:13,817 --> 02:22:16,110
...open the basket on the roof...

2397
02:22:16,278 --> 02:22:20,198
...let the birds fly,
and like the famous ape...

2398

...try to figure things out
by climbing into the basket...

2399
02:22:24,620 --> 02:22:27,288
...and end up breaking your own neck.

...if words are made of breath...

2402
02:22:33,629 --> 02:22:35,296
...and breath is life...

2403
02:22:35,464 --> 02:22:38,758
...I have no life to breathe
what you've said to me.

2405
02:22:43,513 --> 02:22:45,973
Oh, I forgot.

2406
02:22:47,976 --> 02:22:49,477
That's been decided.

2407
02:22:49,645 --> 02:22:51,771
There are letters sealed.

2408
02:22:51,939 --> 02:22:53,689
And my two school friends...

as much as I trust venomous snakes...

...they're carrying the orders.

2411

They have to clear my path
and lead me into trouble.

2412
02:23:01,531 --> 02:23:03,032
Let it happen.

2413
02:23:03,200 --> 02:23:06,994
It's fun to see the engineer
blown up by his own bomb.

2414
02:23:07,162 --> 02:23:09,413
And it will be tough...

2415
02:23:09,706 --> 02:23:14,752
...but I'll dig one yard
below their traps...

2416
02:23:14,920 --> 02:23:18,464
...and blow them to the moon.

2417
02:23:19,007 --> 02:23:24,929
Oh, it's so satisfying
when two schemes collide perfectly.

2418
02:23:25,514 --> 02:23:27,473
This man will get me moving.

2419
02:23:27,641 --> 02:23:30,184
I'll drag the body into the next room.

2420

Good night, Mother.

2421

was a foolish, chattering fool.

Come on, sir...

02:24:00,215 --> 02:24:03,551
...let's wrap things up with you.

these sighs, these deep breaths...

We need to understand them.

Oh, my lord,
what I've seen tonight.

2432

What, Gertrude? How is Hamlet?

2433
02:24:44,301 --> 02:24:49,138
As mad as the sea and wind
when they fight to see which is stronger.

Good sir, whose troops are these?

2593

Against a part of Poland.

- Who leads them, sir?
- The nephew of Old Norway, Fortinbras.

Is it against the heart of Poland, sir,
or just a border area?

...with no exaggeration...

2598

Just an animal, nothing more.

Surely, the one who made us
with such broad thinking...

that capability and godlike reason...

...to sit unused within us.

2622

of thinking too much about the outcome--

A thought which, divided...

...even for something as small as an eggshell.

2637
02:36:48,608 --> 02:36:53,320
To truly be great
is not to act without a significant reason...

2638

...but to find a reason in something small
when honor is at stake.

who was headed to England...
...if your name is Horatio,

2897
02:53:24,186 --> 02:53:26,979
as I believe it is.
"Horatio, when you have

2898
02:53:29,107 --> 02:53:31,317
read this...
...give these men some way

2899
02:53:31,485 --> 02:53:35,279
to reach the king. They have letters for him.
Before we were two days at sea...

2900
02:53:36,323 --> 02:53:37,948

2901
02:53:38,116 --> 02:53:42,453
...a pirate ship fully armed for battle
chased us.

2902
02:53:42,621 --> 02:53:44,330
Realizing we were too slow...

2903
02:53:44,498 --> 02:53:47,958
...we summoned forced bravery,
and during the fight, I boarded their ship.

2904
02:53:48,126 --> 02:53:52,421
They quickly got away from our ship,
leaving me as their only prisoner.

2905
02:53:52,589 --> 02:53:54,757
They treated me
like merciful thieves...

2906
02:53:54,925 --> 02:53:58,427
...but they knew what they were doing:
I'm supposed to do them a favor.

2907
02:53:58,595 --> 02:54:00,596
Make sure the king gets the letters
I sent...

2908
02:54:00,764 --> 02:54:04,892
...and come to me as fast
as if you were fleeing death.

2909
02:54:05,060 --> 02:54:08,771
I have things to tell you
that will leave you speechless...

2910
02:54:08,939 --> 02:54:12,274
...though they are too trivial
for the seriousness of the situation.

2911
02:54:12,442 --> 02:54:15,111
These good people
will bring you to where I am.

2912
02:54:15,278 --> 02:54:19,532
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
are heading to England.

2913
02:54:19,699 --> 02:54:23,202
I have a lot to tell you about them.
Goodbye.

2914
02:54:23,370 --> 02:54:27,540
From your friend, Hamlet."

2915
02:54:28,166 --> 02:54:30,501
Come, I'll make way
for your letters...

2916
02:54:30,669 --> 02:54:33,003
...and do it quickly
so you can guide me...

2917
02:54:33,171 --> 02:54:35,131
...to the person you got them from.

2918
02:54:35,507 --> 02:54:38,509
Now your conscience must
clear me of any blame...

2919
02:54:38,677 --> 02:54:42,138
...and you must consider me
a friend...

2920
02:54:42,305 --> 02:54:45,141
...since you've heard,
and understood...

2921
02:54:45,308 --> 02:54:49,937
...that the one who killed your noble father
also tried to kill me.

2922
02:54:50,105 --> 02:54:52,898
That's clear. But tell me...

2923
02:54:53,150 --> 02:54:55,734
...why didn't you take action
against these serious crimes...

2924
02:54:55,902 --> 02:55:01,031
...so terrible and severe,
when your safety...

2925
02:55:01,199 --> 02:55:03,909
...wisdom, and everything else
urged you to do so?

2926
02:55:04,077 --> 02:55:09,665
Oh, for two specific reasons
that might seem weak to you...

2927
02:55:09,833 --> 02:55:11,584
...but are strong to me.

2928
02:55:11,751 --> 02:55:16,297
The queen, his mother,
is almost entirely dependent on him.

2929
02:55:16,590 --> 02:55:17,840
And for myself—

2930
02:55:18,008 --> 02:55:22,303
Whether it's a virtue or a curse,
be it one or the other.

2931
02:55:22,971 --> 02:55:27,266
—she is so essential
to my life and soul...

2932
02:55:27,434 --> 02:55:31,020
...that, like a star that doesn't move
except in its orbit...

2933
02:55:31,188 --> 02:55:34,106
...I couldn't act without her.

2934
02:55:34,983 --> 02:55:38,110
The other reason
I couldn't make it public...

2935
02:55:38,278 --> 02:55:41,697
...is the great love
the people have for him...

2936
02:55:41,865 --> 02:55:44,283
...who, overlooking all his faults
because of their affection...

2937
02:55:44,451 --> 02:55:46,952
...would, like a spring
that turns wood to stone...

2938
02:55:47,120 --> 02:55:49,163
...turn his chains into blessings...

2939
02:55:49,331 --> 02:55:52,458
...so that my efforts,
too weak for such strong opposition...

2940
02:55:52,626 --> 02:55:56,921
...would have backfired,
and not hit their target.

2941
02:55:57,964 --> 02:56:01,258
And so I've lost a noble father.

2942
02:56:01,968 --> 02:56:04,386
A sister driven to desperation...

2943
02:56:04,554 --> 02:56:07,139
...whose worth,
if praise could be given again...

2944
02:56:07,307 --> 02:56:11,727
...stood as a challenger, on a pedestal...

2945
02:56:12,437 --> 02:56:16,315
...of all the age for her virtues.

2946
02:56:18,818 --> 02:56:23,155
- But I'll have my revenge.
- Don't lose sleep over that.

2947
02:56:23,323 --> 02:56:26,242
You must not think
that we are so dull and lifeless...

2948
02:56:26,409 --> 02:56:29,787
...that we can let danger shake us
and think it's fun.

2949
02:56:29,955 --> 02:56:32,581
You'll hear more soon.

2950
02:56:33,375 --> 02:56:38,921
I loved your father, and we love ourselves.

2951
02:56:39,089 --> 02:56:42,299
And that, I hope,
will teach you to imagine—

2952
02:56:42,467 --> 02:56:45,094
CLAUDIUS:
What's going on? What's the news?

2953
02:56:45,804 --> 02:56:48,347
Letters, my lord, from Hamlet.

2954
02:56:48,515 --> 02:56:50,724
This one is for Your Majesty,
and this one is for the queen.

2955
02:56:50,892 --> 02:56:52,851
From Hamlet? Who delivered them?

2956
02:56:53,019 --> 02:56:55,938
Sailors, my lord, they say.
I didn't see them myself.

2957
02:56:56,106 --> 02:56:58,357
Claudio gave them to me.

2958
02:56:58,525 --> 02:57:01,151
He got them
from the person who brought them.

2959
02:57:01,319 --> 02:57:04,196
CLAUDIUS: Laertes, you should hear them.
Leave us.

2960
02:57:07,200 --> 02:57:11,453
"High and mighty, you should know
that I have arrived unexpectedly in your kingdom.

2961
02:57:11,621 --> 02:57:14,164
Tomorrow, I will ask permission
to see you in person...

2962
02:57:14,332 --> 02:57:17,876
...when I will, first asking your pardon,
explain the reasons...

2963
02:57:18,044 --> 02:57:21,380
...for my sudden and strange return.
Hamlet."

2964
02:57:21,548 --> 02:57:23,173
What does this mean?

2965
02:57:23,341 --> 02:57:26,552
Have all the others come back too?
Or is this some kind of trick, and not true?

2966
02:57:26,720 --> 02:57:30,055
- Do you recognize the handwriting?
- It's Hamlet's writing.

2967
02:57:30,223 --> 02:57:33,726
"Unexpectedly," and in a postscript here
he says "alone."

2968
02:57:33,893 --> 02:57:37,438
- Can you give me advice?
- I'm confused, my lord.

2969
02:57:38,398 --> 02:57:40,733
But let him come.

2970
02:57:41,568 --> 02:57:46,071
It stirs up the anger in my heart
that I will live to tell him to his face:

2971
02:57:46,239 --> 02:57:47,489
"This is how you die."

2972
02:57:47,824 --> 02:57:51,785
If that's the case, Laertes—
How could it be otherwise?

2973
02:57:51,953 --> 02:57:53,162
—will you follow my lead?

2974
02:57:53,330 --> 02:57:55,956
Yes, my lord,
as long as you don't make peace with him.

2975
02:57:56,124 --> 02:57:58,167
For your own peace.

2976
02:57:58,460 --> 02:58:00,794
If he's returned now,
having stopped his journey...

2977
02:58:00,962 --> 02:58:03,088
...and he plans
not to continue it...

2978
02:58:03,256 --> 02:58:05,924
...I will lead him into a trap,
which I've already planned...

2979
02:58:06,092 --> 02:58:09,928
...where he won't have a choice but to fall.
And for his death...

2980
02:58:10,638 --> 02:58:12,681
...no blame will come our way.

2981
02:58:12,849 --> 02:58:15,100
Even his mother will think it was an accident

2982
02:58:15,268 --> 02:58:18,270
and call it a mishap.
My lord, I'll follow your lead.

2983
02:58:18,438 --> 02:58:19,897
Especially if you can plan it

2984
02:58:20,065 --> 02:58:23,025
so that I can be the one to do it.
That works perfectly.

2985
02:58:23,193 --> 02:58:24,943
You've been talked about

2986
02:58:25,111 --> 02:58:27,780
a lot since your travels—
And Hamlet has heard about it.

2987
02:58:27,947 --> 02:58:29,365
—for a skill

2988
02:58:29,532 --> 02:58:31,950
they say you excel in.
Your overall talents didn't make him

2989
02:58:32,118 --> 02:58:34,995
as envious as that one skill did...
...which, in my opinion,

2990
02:58:35,163 --> 02:58:39,500
is the least impressive.
- What skill is that, my lord?

2991
02:58:39,667 --> 02:58:42,795
- A small accomplishment for the young...
...but important too.

2992
02:58:42,962 --> 02:58:44,171
For youth suits

2993
02:58:44,339 --> 02:58:48,008
the carefree style it wears...
...just as much as old age suits

2994
02:58:48,176 --> 02:58:54,431
its serious and dignified attire.
Two months ago,

2995
02:58:55,308 --> 02:58:59,144
there was a gentleman from Normandy here.
I've seen myself,

2996
02:58:59,312 --> 02:59:01,730
and fought against, the French...
...and they're good on horseback,

2997
02:59:01,898 --> 02:59:06,151
but this guy was like magic.
He seemed to become one with his horse...

2998
02:59:06,319 --> 02:59:08,028
...and performed such amazing

2999
02:59:08,196 --> 02:59:10,489
feats with it...
...as if he and the horse

3000
02:59:10,657 --> 02:59:13,826
were one incredible creature.

3001
02:59:13,993 --> 02:59:17,913
He exceeded my expectations so far.
I can't match his skill in deception and tricks.

3002
02:59:18,081 --> 02:59:20,916
...I'm not as good as he was.

3003
02:59:21,918 --> 02:59:24,128
- Was he a Norman?
- Yes, a Norman.

3004
02:59:24,295 --> 02:59:26,296
- I bet it was Lamord.
- Exactly, it was him.

3005
02:59:26,464 --> 02:59:30,342
I know him well. He's truly the pride
and jewel of our nation.

3006
02:59:30,510 --> 02:59:31,969
He spoke highly of you...

3007
02:59:32,137 --> 02:59:36,682
...and praised your skill
in art and defense...

3008
02:59:36,850 --> 02:59:39,184
...especially with your sword...

3009
02:59:39,352 --> 02:59:42,479
...saying it would be amazing
if anyone could match you.

3010
02:59:42,647 --> 02:59:46,275
He swore that their country's fencers
had no skill or awareness...

3011
02:59:46,443 --> 02:59:48,652
...if they faced you, sir.

3012
02:59:48,820 --> 02:59:52,865
His praise
made Hamlet so envious...

3013
02:59:53,032 --> 02:59:55,200
...that all he could do
was wish and beg...

3014
02:59:55,368 --> 02:59:58,036
...for you to come quickly
to spar with him.

3015
02:59:58,204 --> 03:00:01,290
- So, from this--
- What do you mean by this, my lord?

3016
03:00:01,458 --> 03:00:03,959
Laertes, did you truly care for your father?

3017
03:00:04,127 --> 03:00:08,130
Or are you just pretending to be sad,
showing emotion without feeling?

3018
03:00:08,298 --> 03:00:09,506
Why do you ask?

3019
03:00:09,674 --> 03:00:13,010
Not because I doubt
you loved your father...

3020
03:00:13,178 --> 03:00:17,764
...but because I know
love changes over time...

3021
03:00:18,183 --> 03:00:21,560
...and I've seen, through experience...

3022
03:00:21,728 --> 03:00:25,147
...that time dulls its intensity.

3023
03:00:25,315 --> 03:00:28,317
Within the very flame of love...
...there's something that can

3024
03:00:28,485 --> 03:00:33,071
diminish it.
And nothing stays perfect forever.

3025
03:00:33,239 --> 03:00:35,741
For goodness, when it becomes excessive,

3026
03:00:35,909 --> 03:00:41,955
destroys itself.
What we intend to do,

3027
03:00:42,790 --> 03:00:46,752
we should do when we want to.
Because this intention changes...

3028
03:00:46,920 --> 03:00:48,921
...and faces obstacles and delays...

3029
03:00:49,088 --> 03:00:50,756
...as numerous as there are people,

3030
03:00:50,924 --> 03:00:54,009
actions, and events.
And then this intention

3031
03:00:54,177 --> 03:00:59,848
becomes like a wasted sigh...
...that harms by relieving.

3032
03:01:00,016 --> 03:01:01,725
But let's get to the heart of the matter.

3033
03:01:02,352 --> 03:01:05,771
Hamlet is coming back.
What would you do

3034
03:01:05,939 --> 03:01:10,734
to prove you're truly your father's son...
...in actions, not just words?

3035
03:01:10,902 --> 03:01:12,694
I'd kill him in a church.

3036
03:01:12,862 --> 03:01:15,781
No place should protect a murderer.

3037
03:01:16,824 --> 03:01:20,619
Revenge should have no limits.
But, dear Laertes, will you do this?

3038
03:01:22,622 --> 03:01:25,582
Stay hidden in your room.

3039
03:01:26,793 --> 03:01:29,795
When Hamlet returns, he'll know

3040
03:01:29,963 --> 03:01:32,464
that you're back.

3041
03:01:32,632 --> 03:01:35,342
We'll have people praise
your skills...

3042
03:01:35,510 --> 03:01:37,803
...and enhance the reputation
the Frenchman gave you.

3043
03:01:37,971 --> 03:01:40,931
We'll bring you together,
and place bets on you both.

3044

If I knowingly drown myself,
it's an act.

If the man goes to the water

Remember that.

But if the water comes to him
and drowns him, he didn't drown himself.

...jawless, and knocked
around the head with a gravedigger's spade.

3200
03:11:50,624 --> 03:11:55,962
Here's a fine change,
if only we could see it.

3201
03:11:56,130 --> 03:12:01,259
Did these bones cost no more to create
than to play games with them?

3202
03:12:02,636 --> 03:12:04,512
Just thinking about it makes me ache.

HAMLET:
Oh, there's another one.

3204
03:12:06,765 --> 03:12:09,851
Why couldn't that be the skull
of a lawyer?

3205
03:12:10,019 --> 03:12:15,773
Where are his clever arguments now, his tricks,
his cases, his property, and his schemes?

3206
03:12:16,567 --> 03:12:18,484
HAMLET: Why does he allow
this rude guy now...

3207
03:12:18,652 --> 03:12:21,196
...to hit him on the head
with a dirty shovel...

03:12:21,363 --> 03:12:23,781
...and not tell him
about his legal rights? Hmm?

3209
03:12:24,533 --> 03:12:28,328
This guy might have been in his time
a big land buyer...

...with his laws,
his acknowledgments, his fines...

...his double deals, his recoveries.

3212
03:12:35,294 --> 03:12:40,298
Is this the end of his wealth
and the result of his recoveries...

3213
03:12:40,466 --> 03:12:43,426
...to have his fine head full of dirt?

3214
03:12:44,803 --> 03:12:47,430
Will his legal documents
not guarantee him more of his purchases...

3215
03:12:47,598 --> 03:12:52,894
...and double ones too, than the size
of a piece of paper?

03:12:53,062 --> 03:12:57,523
The very deeds of his land
will barely fit in this box...

3217
03:12:57,691 --> 03:13:00,401
...and must the owner himself
have no more, huh?

3218
03:13:00,569 --> 03:13:02,946
Not a bit more, my lord.

Isn't parchment made from sheepskins?

3220
03:13:05,658 --> 03:13:08,660
Yes, my lord, and from calfskins too.

3221
03:13:08,827 --> 03:13:11,955
They are sheep and calves
who seek assurance in that.

HAMLET:
I will talk to this guy.

For such a guest is fitting

3226
03:13:27,763 --> 03:13:29,931
I think it's yours, since you're lying in it.

3227
03:13:30,099 --> 03:13:32,850
You're lying about it, sir,
so it's not yours.

3228
03:13:33,018 --> 03:13:36,688
For my part, I don't lie in it,
and yet it is mine.

3229
03:13:36,855 --> 03:13:39,399
You do lie in it,
to be in it and say it's yours.

3230
03:13:39,566 --> 03:13:42,277
It's for the dead, not for the living,
so you're lying.

3231
03:13:42,444 --> 03:13:45,488
It's a quick lie, sir,
it'll come back from me to you.

- For no man, sir.

- For no one, either.

Who is going to be buried in it?

Someone who was a woman, sir,
but God rest her soul, she's dead.

How straightforward this guy is.

We must speak clearly,
or confusion will get us.

3238
03:14:01,380 --> 03:14:04,340
By the Lord, Horatio, for the past three years
I've noticed it.

3239
03:14:04,508 --> 03:14:07,885
Times have changed so much
that the peasant's toe...

3240
03:14:08,053 --> 03:14:11,306
...comes so close to the courtier's heel
it rubs his sore spot.

Of all the days in the year,
I started on the day...

3243
03:14:16,103 --> 03:14:19,105
...that our last king, Hamlet,
defeated Fortinbras.

3244
03:14:19,273 --> 03:14:22,066
- How long ago was that?
- Can't you tell that?

3245
03:14:22,234 --> 03:14:24,277
Any fool can tell that.

3246
03:14:24,445 --> 03:14:27,113
It was the very day
that young Hamlet was born.

3247
03:14:27,906 --> 03:14:30,074
The one who went mad and was sent to England.

3248

Yes, indeed, why was he sent
to England?

3249
03:14:32,494 --> 03:14:34,787
Well, because he was mad.

3250
03:14:34,955 --> 03:14:38,541
He'll recover his sanity there,
or if he doesn't, it won't matter much there.

3251
03:14:38,751 --> 03:14:41,169
- Why?
- It won't be noticeable in him there.

- Very strangely, they say.

3255
03:14:48,010 --> 03:14:51,554
- How strangely?
- Honestly, just by losing his mind.

- Why him more than others?

Oh, a curse
on him for being a mad rogue.

He once poured a jug of wine
on my head.

It would be overthinking
to think like that.

This suggests the body they follow

- I remember them, my lord.

Sir, I had a kind of internal struggle
that kept me from sleeping.

I thought I was lying
worse than prisoners in chains.

3406
03:24:30,926 --> 03:24:33,761
Recklessly, and thank goodness for recklessness...

...we sometimes find that our mistakes
actually help us...

...when our well-thought-out plans fail...

- No matter how rough our attempts are.
- That's definitely true.

wrapped around me in the dark...

...I fumbled to find them, got what I wanted,
handled their documents...

to my own room...

my fears making me forget my manners...

Oh, what royal trickery.

filled with all sorts of reasons...

and England's too, with urgency!

Being surrounded
by such treachery--

Before I could even think...

3426
03:25:42,122 --> 03:25:44,081

- Yes, please.

A strong request from the king...

3433
03:26:05,103 --> 03:26:07,730
...since England was his loyal ally...

3434

...as their friendship
might thrive like a palm tree...

3435

...as peace should always
wear its wheat garland...

3436
03:26:13,445 --> 03:26:15,487
...and stand as a link
between their friendships...

3437
03:26:15,655 --> 03:26:19,241
...and many similar reasons
of great importance...

3438

...that upon reading
and understanding these contents...

3439
03:26:22,454 --> 03:26:25,289
...without any further discussion
more or less...

3440
03:26:25,457 --> 03:26:30,461
...he should have those messengers
put to immediate death.

- Without even time for confession.
- How was this sealed?

Well, even in that, heaven was on my side.

3443
03:26:35,050 --> 03:26:37,301
I had my father's ring in my purse...

3444
03:26:37,469 --> 03:26:39,762
...which was a copy
of the Danish seal.

3445
03:26:39,929 --> 03:26:42,097
I folded the document
like the original...

3446
03:26:42,265 --> 03:26:45,809
...signed it, stamped it,
and placed it securely...

3447
03:26:45,977 --> 03:26:48,145
...the switch never discovered, ha.

...Guildenstern and Rosencrantz are going to die.

You know, they were eager
to take on this job.

3453
03:27:02,911 --> 03:27:05,037
I don't feel guilty about them.

3454
03:27:05,205 --> 03:27:08,999
Their downfall
is because of their own actions.

3455
03:27:09,167 --> 03:27:11,335
It's dangerous
when someone of lower status gets...

3456

...caught between the fierce conflicts
of powerful enemies.

Don't you think
it's my duty now—

The one who killed my father
and seduced my mother...

3460
03:27:23,014 --> 03:27:25,432
...interfered with my chances
and my ambitions...

3461
03:27:25,600 --> 03:27:28,811
...tried to take my life,
and with such deceit.

3462

Isn't it the right thing
to take him down myself?

3463
03:27:32,565 --> 03:27:34,691
And wouldn't it be wrong...

3464
03:27:34,859 --> 03:27:38,529
...to let this corrupt person
cause more harm?

3465

He'll soon find out
from England...

...what happened with that situation.

03:27:44,536 --> 03:27:46,537
It won't take long.

3468
03:27:47,455 --> 03:27:49,623
In the meantime, I have control...

3469
03:27:50,500 --> 03:27:52,501
...and a man's life...

3470
03:27:53,711 --> 03:27:57,256
...is as easy to end as saying "one."

3471
03:27:59,676 --> 03:28:05,055
But I'm really sorry, dear Horatio,
that I lost my cool with Laertes.

3472
03:28:05,223 --> 03:28:10,352
Because in his situation,
I see a reflection of my own.

3473
03:28:11,020 --> 03:28:13,564

You're better off not knowing him,
because it's a flaw to be acquainted with him.

3481
03:28:35,837 --> 03:28:37,880
He owns a lot of land, and it's fertile.

3482

Even if a beast rules over other beasts,
his place will be at the king's table.

He's a fool, but as I said,
he owns a lot of worthless land.

Uh, wear your hat properly.
It's meant for your head.

I appreciate it, but it's very hot.

No, it's quite cold. The wind is from the north.

But, my lord, the King asked me
to inform you...

3495
03:29:18,880 --> 03:29:21,089
...that he has placed a big bet
on you.

3496
03:29:21,507 --> 03:29:24,134
OSRIC: Sir, here's the situation.
- Please, remember this.

3497
03:29:25,929 --> 03:29:29,014
No, really, my lord,
for my comfort, honestly.

3498
03:29:29,307 --> 03:29:33,060
Sir, Laertes has just arrived at court.

3499
03:29:33,228 --> 03:29:36,480
Believe me, he's a true gentleman...

3500
03:29:36,648 --> 03:29:41,610
...with many admirable qualities,
very sociable and impressive.

3501
03:29:41,778 --> 03:29:46,782
Honestly, to speak sincerely about him,
he is the standard or example of nobility.

3502
03:29:46,950 --> 03:29:51,036
Because you'll find in him the essence
of what a gentleman should be.

3503
03:29:51,204 --> 03:29:53,705
Sir, describing him
loses nothing in your words.

3504
03:29:53,873 --> 03:29:55,832
HAMLET: Even though I know
listing his qualities one by one...

3505
03:29:56,000 --> 03:29:59,920
...would overwhelm the memory
and not compare to his quick wit.

3506
03:30:00,088 --> 03:30:03,340
In truth,
I consider him to be a person of great importance...

3507
03:30:03,508 --> 03:30:07,094
...and his mix of scarcity and uniqueness,
to describe him accurately...

3508
03:30:07,262 --> 03:30:08,804
...he is his own reflection...

3509
03:30:08,972 --> 03:30:12,057
...and anyone who tries to follow him,
would only be his shadow, nothing more.

3510
03:30:12,225 --> 03:30:15,352
Your lordship speaks
very accurately about him.

3511
03:30:18,147 --> 03:30:19,940
What's the point, sir?

3512
03:30:20,441 --> 03:30:22,359
Why are we discussing the gentleman...

3513
03:30:22,527 --> 03:30:25,779
- ...with such unrefined words?
- Sir?

3514
03:30:26,072 --> 03:30:29,074
Isn't it possible to understand
in another language?

3515
03:30:29,242 --> 03:30:30,534
You will, sir, truly.

3516
03:30:30,702 --> 03:30:33,495
What's the purpose of mentioning
this gentleman?

3517
03:30:33,663 --> 03:30:35,706
- Laertes?
- His wallet is already empty.

3518
03:30:35,873 --> 03:30:37,499
All his fine words are used up.

3519
03:30:37,667 --> 03:30:40,043
- About him, sir.
- I know you're not unaware--

3520
03:30:40,211 --> 03:30:43,755
I wish you were. But honestly, if you were,
it wouldn't help me much. Well?

3521
03:30:43,923 --> 03:30:46,300
You are aware
of how excellent Laertes is.

3522
03:30:46,467 --> 03:30:49,386
I dare not admit that,
in case I compare myself to him in excellence.

3523
03:30:49,554 --> 03:30:51,555
But to truly know a man
is to know oneself.

3524
03:30:51,723 --> 03:30:53,223
I mean, sir, in terms of his skill.

3525
03:30:53,391 --> 03:30:57,227
But in the reputation given to him by others,
in his reward, he's unmatched.

3526
03:30:57,395 --> 03:30:58,979
- What's his weapon?
- Sword and dagger.

3527
03:30:59,147 --> 03:31:00,772
- Those are two of his weapons. But okay.
- Ha.

3528
03:31:00,940 --> 03:31:04,609
The king, sir, has bet
six Barbary horses with him...

3529
03:31:04,777 --> 03:31:07,321
- ...against which he has wagered--
- Wagered?

3530
03:31:07,488 --> 03:31:10,741
--as I understand, six French swords
and daggers...

3531
03:31:10,908 --> 03:31:14,578
...with their accessories,
like belts, hangers, and so on.

3532
03:31:14,746 --> 03:31:18,081
Three of the accessories, honestly,
are quite fancy...

3533
03:31:18,249 --> 03:31:20,542
...very fitting to the handles...

3534
03:31:20,710 --> 03:31:24,546
...very elegant accessories,
and quite imaginative.

3535
03:31:24,714 --> 03:31:26,840
What do you call the accessories?

3536
03:31:27,008 --> 03:31:29,718
I knew you needed clarification
before you were done.

3537
03:31:29,886 --> 03:31:31,970
The accessories, sir, are the hangers.

3538
03:31:32,138 --> 03:31:35,432
The term would be more appropriate
if we could carry cannons at our sides.

3539
03:31:35,600 --> 03:31:37,601
- I wish they could be hangers until then.
- Ah, ha!

3540
03:31:37,769 --> 03:31:40,729
But moving on: six Barbary horses
against six French swords...

3541
03:31:40,897 --> 03:31:44,691
...their accessories,
and three imaginative...

3542
03:31:44,859 --> 03:31:46,818
- Accessories.
- ...accessories.

3543
03:31:46,986 --> 03:31:51,865
That's the French bet against the Danish.
Why is this "wagered," as you call it?

3544
03:31:52,033 --> 03:31:55,702
The king, sir, has bet, sir, that
in a dozen rounds between you and him...

3545
03:31:55,870 --> 03:31:58,413
...he won't beat you by more than three hits.

3546
03:31:58,581 --> 03:32:00,374
He has bet on 12 for nine.

3547
03:32:00,541 --> 03:32:02,459
And it would be tested immediately...

3548
03:32:02,627 --> 03:32:05,087
...if your lordship
would agree to it.

3549
03:32:06,714 --> 03:32:08,632
What if I say no?

3550
03:32:09,801 --> 03:32:13,387
I mean, my lord,
the challenge of your participation in the test.

3551
03:32:14,722 --> 03:32:16,556
Sir, I'll walk here in the hall.

3552
03:32:16,724 --> 03:32:19,684
If it pleases His Majesty,
this is my usual time for a break.

3553
03:32:19,852 --> 03:32:21,019
Bring the foils.

3554
03:32:21,187 --> 03:32:23,730
If the gentleman is willing,
and the king sticks to his plan...

3555
03:32:23,898 --> 03:32:26,316
...I'll win for him if I can.

3556
03:32:26,484 --> 03:32:31,405
If not, I'll only gain my shame
and a few hits.

3557
03:32:32,323 --> 03:32:35,325
- Should I deliver your message like this?
- Yes, to this effect, sir.

3558
03:32:35,493 --> 03:32:38,829
In whatever style suits you.

3559
03:32:39,122 --> 03:32:40,997
I send my respects to your lordship.

3560
03:32:41,249 --> 03:32:42,707
Yours truly.

3561
03:32:44,001 --> 03:32:45,252
HAMLET:
Um....

3562
03:32:57,306 --> 03:33:00,684
He praises himself well,
since no one else will.

3563
03:33:00,852 --> 03:33:03,145
This young bird runs off
with the eggshell still on his head.

3564
03:33:03,312 --> 03:33:06,022
He was agreeable with his nurse
before he even drank her milk.

3565
03:33:06,190 --> 03:33:10,861
That's how he is—like many others
that this foolish age admires.

3566
03:33:11,028 --> 03:33:14,990
They've only learned the current trends
and the outward manners of meeting...

3567
03:33:15,158 --> 03:33:16,783
...a sort of superficial collection...

3568
03:33:16,951 --> 03:33:20,704
...that carries them through
the most popular opinions...

3569
03:33:20,872 --> 03:33:24,666
...and if you test them,
they burst like bubbles.

3570
03:33:33,634 --> 03:33:34,926
My lord.

3571
03:33:35,094 --> 03:33:38,221
His Majesty sent a message to you
through young Osric...

3572
03:33:38,389 --> 03:33:41,766
...who reports back to him,
that you will meet him in the hall.

3573
03:33:41,934 --> 03:33:45,937
He wants to know if you're still willing
to play with Laertes...

3574
03:33:46,105 --> 03:33:49,441
- ...or if you need more time.
- I'm committed to my plans.

3575
03:33:49,609 --> 03:33:53,695
They follow the king's wishes:
If he's ready, so am I.

3576
03:33:53,863 --> 03:33:56,948
Now or whenever,
as long as I'm as capable as I am now.

3577
03:33:57,116 --> 03:33:59,367
The king and queen and everyone
are coming down.

3578
03:33:59,535 --> 03:34:00,911
Just in time.

3579
03:34:01,078 --> 03:34:04,206
The queen wants you
to be friendly with Laertes...

3580
03:34:04,373 --> 03:34:05,707
...before you start playing.

3581
03:34:06,250 --> 03:34:07,792
She's given me good instructions.

3582
03:34:16,093 --> 03:34:18,762
You'll lose this bet, my lord.

3583
03:34:23,267 --> 03:34:25,519
I don't think so.

3584
03:34:25,853 --> 03:34:30,232
Since he went to France,
I've been practicing continuously.

3585
03:34:30,858 --> 03:34:33,944
I'll win with the odds.

3586
03:34:35,863 --> 03:34:40,825
But you wouldn't believe
how uneasy I feel inside.

3587
03:34:41,327 --> 03:34:42,786
[SIGHS]

3588
03:34:42,954 --> 03:34:44,496
But it doesn't matter.

3589
03:34:44,664 --> 03:34:46,873
No, my good lord.

3590
03:34:47,041 --> 03:34:49,042
HAMLET:
It's just foolishness.

3591
03:34:50,419 --> 03:34:55,423
But it's the kind of doubt
that might trouble a woman.

3592
03:34:55,800 --> 03:34:59,928
If you feel uneasy, listen to it.

3593
03:35:00,471 --> 03:35:03,473
I'll stop them from coming here,
and say you're not ready.

3594
03:35:03,641 --> 03:35:05,392
Not at all.

3595
03:35:06,477 --> 03:35:09,145
We reject predictions.

3596
03:35:11,482 --> 03:35:15,860
There's a special fate
even in a sparrow's fall.

3597
03:35:17,321 --> 03:35:20,323
If it's meant to happen now, it won't be later.

3598
03:35:21,659 --> 03:35:24,744
If it won't happen later, it will be now.

3599
03:35:26,122 --> 03:35:28,415
If it's not now...

3600
03:35:30,876 --> 03:35:34,087
...it will happen eventually.

3601
03:35:35,715 --> 03:35:38,216
Being prepared is everything.

3602
03:35:39,135 --> 03:35:43,138
Since no one knows anything
about what they leave behind...

3603
03:35:45,141 --> 03:35:47,892
...why worry about leaving early?

3604
03:35:50,813 --> 03:35:52,856
Let it be.

3605
03:36:19,508 --> 03:36:24,220
Come on, Hamlet, come here,
and take this hand from me.

3606
03:36:26,641 --> 03:36:28,892
Please forgive me, sir.

3607
03:36:29,644 --> 03:36:32,062
I've wronged you.

3608
03:36:32,647 --> 03:36:34,439
But forgive me as a gentleman would.

3609
03:36:34,899 --> 03:36:37,567
HAMLET: Everyone here knows,
and you must have heard...

3610
03:36:37,735 --> 03:36:40,487
...how I'm troubled
by a severe distraction.

3611
03:36:40,655 --> 03:36:45,617
What I've done that might have upset
your nature, honor, and expectations...

3612
03:36:45,785 --> 03:36:48,411
...I declare was madness.

3613
03:36:48,579 --> 03:36:51,748
Was it Hamlet who wronged Laertes?
Never Hamlet.

3614
03:36:52,416 --> 03:36:56,378
If Hamlet is taken away from himself, and
when he's not himself, he wrongs Laertes...

3615
03:36:56,545 --> 03:36:59,673
...then it's not Hamlet doing it,
Hamlet denies it.

3616
03:36:59,840 --> 03:37:00,924
Who does it, then?

3617
03:37:02,426 --> 03:37:04,094
His madness.

3618
03:37:04,261 --> 03:37:07,681
If that's the case, Hamlet is on the side
that's been wronged.

3619
03:37:07,848 --> 03:37:10,392
His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.

3620
03:37:11,352 --> 03:37:14,938
HAMLET: Sir, in front of everyone here,
let me say that I didn't intend any harm...

3621
03:37:15,106 --> 03:37:19,275
...and free me in your generous thoughts...
...so much that it's like I shot an arrow

3622
03:37:19,443 --> 03:37:23,738
over the house...
...and accidentally hurt my brother.

3623
03:37:23,906 --> 03:37:25,448
I am satisfied in my heart...

3624
03:37:27,827 --> 03:37:29,452
...which should motivate me

3625
03:37:29,620 --> 03:37:33,790
most to get revenge.
But when it comes to honor...

3626
03:37:33,958 --> 03:37:36,334
...I stand apart,

3627
03:37:36,502 --> 03:37:39,546
and won't reconcile...
...until some respected elders

3628
03:37:39,714 --> 03:37:42,298
of known honor...
...give me a reason and precedent for peace

3629
03:37:42,466 --> 03:37:46,386
to keep my reputation intact.
But until then,

3630
03:37:47,430 --> 03:37:52,726
I accept your offered friendship like love...
...and won't wrong it.

3631
03:37:53,686 --> 03:37:54,978
I accept it freely...

3632
03:37:55,146 --> 03:37:57,480
...and will play this friendly match

3633
03:37:58,649 --> 03:38:02,193
openly.
HAMLET:

3634
03:38:03,904 --> 03:38:05,280
Give us the swords. Let's go.
- Give me one.

3635
03:38:05,656 --> 03:38:08,408
- I'll be your opponent, Laertes.
In my ignorance, your skill will,

3636
03:38:08,576 --> 03:38:13,163
like a star in the darkest night...
...shine brightly.

3637
03:38:13,330 --> 03:38:14,831
- You're mocking me, sir.

3638
03:38:14,999 --> 03:38:18,960
- No, I swear.
Give them the swords, young Osric.

3639
03:38:19,128 --> 03:38:20,962
CLAUDIUS:

3640
03:38:24,925 --> 03:38:26,634
Cousin Hamlet, do you know the bet?
Yes, my lord. You've placed the odds

3641
03:38:26,802 --> 03:38:30,013
on the weaker side.
CLAUDIUS:

3642
03:38:30,181 --> 03:38:32,474
I'm not worried. I've seen you both.

Where is this scene?

HORATIO:
What are you looking for?

If it's sorrow or amazement...

Oh, proud death...

The sight is grim...

03:52:12,836 --> 03:52:16,505
...and our news from England
comes too late.
